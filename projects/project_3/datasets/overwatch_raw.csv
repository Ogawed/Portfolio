I mean I think banning people for abusive chat is utterly bs in a videogame, I can understand the chat ban but account suspension really, I would understand if I was being racist or anything but this much is enough in my opinion if you cant handle this much get out off the internet and dont play the game, I know a lot of people are going to say that the community is toxic and whatsoever but come on. The community is not that toxic as people claim to be, this is why blizzard is so damm STRICT with its chat policy now.

47,Overwatch,"So I was playing competitive. We where running a double shield. On the enemy team was a roadhog, dva, ana, Brigitte, junkrat and (frustratingly) bastion. Our whole team just kept getting stunned, trapped knocked back by the no barrier off tanks and the healers while the Bastion was set up on the payload in sentry mode shredding us apart. Even with the shields up we kept getting staggered. Idk why or how their sh**ty composition worked for them. Bastion was only one hitscan on their main source of damage and he can only be in one place while in sentry mode. Our team tried many hero counters to pick off the Bastion (reaper, ashe, widow etc.), but the enemy junkrat, brigitte road kept on flanking our short range teammates while the d.va kept picking off our sniper. That match pissed me the f*** off because if we where to run that same team comp in another match and their playstyle, it just wouldn't work out for us, so why did it work out for them

It wasn't the first time I had bad team comps that made the enemy team win. But I just wanted to know. Have you ever dealt with that kind of situation before. Hell, you can even bring up days of competitive before the role queue.

Dear Mercy’s its not in anyway shameful or unskilled to pocket your DPS for a while, thats literally what your hero is best at,  and damage boosting enables one shot combos for many heros. If your tank gets heavy damage you wouldnt be able to do much anyways.

It feels dumb i even have to say that, but i feel so many mercy’s refuse to hide their ego and pocket a dps as often as DPS forget to tell their mercy their gonna be taking highround on an off-angle and need a little help and well positioned pocketed hitscan DPS is a force to be reckoned with. 

Extra tip : Mercy keep your distance and even cover from the dps so you can heal him without being zapped by a big fat monkey, if you dmg boosted the cree and stood 2 steps away from him its your fault not his that you got zapped to death or had to GA away and leave him to die(generalisation here)",Gold/Plat mercy’s and dps players do that more often pretty please :)

Increase phase cooldown by 1 second but it gives 25% of healing and damage upon use.

140,Overwatch,"I don't mean to make a low effort rant or anything, but the amount of people in general flaming on overwatch I feel like has gotten a lot worse since the whole virus pandemic. 

As a girl who plays, unfortunately this ends up with a lot more sexism and abuse on the game as well as soon as you talk in vc. More kids are at home and end up playing during the day, and not only flame people a lot as it is, but even more so when they realise a teammate is female. The abuse a fellow teammate got today was disgusting, and when I tried to stand up for her I got the exact same too. These kids didn't sound much older than like 13, but were verbally abusing us, calling us whores/egirls/bitches/retards, telling the other girl to get a job because apparently a grown woman shouldn't be playing overwatch, and screaming/moaning into their microphones. 

I get these people are on the younger side and perhaps don't know much better, but I do have to wonder where they learn to act like this and treat people this way. I've also dealt with plenty of older guys who act the exact same, and find it horrible honestly how girls become an easy target, even if they fight back - it's like nothing we can say is valid because we're women playing games, and I hate it.

Of course there are also plenty of nice people, or those who rage more quietly or don't involve the sexist parts, which I think is more normal and understandable. But PLEASE, I just made this because I have noticed in general people are raging a lot more recently, PLEASE be nicer to your teammates. We're all in the same situation right now. Yelling isn't going to help them play better, and if you're abusing them they're not going to want to help you in game. And if you can, maybe encourage others to act better or stand up for others if you hear it happening. Games aren't fun anymore when you face this shit constantly, and generally the quality of games go down immensely.","I know everyone's stuck at home right now, but PLEASE be nicer to people in game"

Worst of all this only occured in overwatch, with my network diagnostics saying I had 0% packet loss.

178,Overwatch,"I have been playing Overwatch on Xbox One since launch in 2016. As a result I have every cosmetic in the game, with the exception of a few golden guns.

I bought Overwatch on PC a while back to play try new heroes on PTR and I’m pretty good with a keyboard and mouse! I’d love to be able to play on PC and Xbox at the same time.

Would it not be possible to have 2 ‘levels’ and 2 competitive SRs for both Console and PC whilst sharing cosmetics between the 2? Kind of how both profiles are shown on these forums? I don’t really ever see my self moving to PC if I’m gonna lose every event skin that’s ever been released, all the special skins (BCF Mercy, Lego Bastion etc), OWL skins, several top 500 sprays and 19 golden guns…

Basically, it would be really nice if we could have one ‘Career Profile’ across accounts which then had a PC/Xbox/PlayStation section with 3 different levels/SRs and Statistics pages but intershared cosmetics and coins/OWL tokens etc.

That way people you’re playing with can see if you play on another console too! They could look at both your PC and Console accounts in game through your career profile!

That way aswell, if players did move to a different console, their level would still be ‘enshrined’ in their profile. Otherwise, if I swap to PC - it’s like my platinum border is gone forever. It’d be nice if people could still see I have a platinum border on console whilst playing on PC?

TLDR: Cross-Platform Cosmetics and Career Profiles would be amazing for Overwatch 2!

I was just wondering if there are any plans for this Blizzard? I know you’ve said it’s not going to happen in OW1 but Overwatch 2 seems like a better time than any!

Thank you",Can cosmetics be transferable between platforms (PC/Xbox/PlayStation) in Overwatch 2?

Dont get me wrong, I like the challenge and it doesnt bother me that much but the amount of smurfs is just insane, and yes I can tell because I used to watch a lot of videos for fun and there's Widowmakers sniping my whole team in the air in rapid sequence, if that's not a big enough indicator, well, most of them do have SMURF on their name...
Shouldnt the game measure MMR instead of using levels even if it's just QP? I'm finding it really hard to improve when I cant even breath or get out of the base without getting massacred at the gates which high ELO parties just mob.
That said I really enjoy the few rare games where everyone is as retarded as I am, I even got some POTGs!

228,Overwatch,"First I want to give credit to Apex Legends as this hero is heavily inspired from this game.

Primary fire(Rail Gun): Shock will be holding a laser gun. It is a single fire weapon with an ammo capacity of 12. The gun will charge for charge for 0.3 seconds then fire a powerful precise laser shot that does 50 damage. This laser has no range

Animation:the gun would look like the havoc from Apex Legends. The charge up animation would have the gun radiate a blue light withing the barrel and then fire, firing a laser that would look similar to Zarya's laser

Ability 1(Jolt): Shock will give her teammate a ""jolt"". This will give them a 40% speed boost for 4 seconds. After the effect wears off or the user dies, the 6 second cooldown begins.

Animation: Shock will look at the target and a cursor will appear (like Zenyatta orbs). Apon activation Shock will shoot a lighting strike from her left hand giving the teammate a jolt. The affected teammate will have an electricity around them.

Ability 2(Lighting Beacon): Shock will place down a totem in front of her. This totem has 150 health and will effect teammates in a 15m radius. This totem will do 50 healing per second and can repair barriers at 100 healing per second. This means any friendly barrier that is on the battlefield will ""heal"" at 100 healing per second. This totem does not need line of sight to affect a teammate. This has a 15 second cooldown when destroyed and Shock can destroy herself as well like Symmetra's teleporter

Animation: while setting up the totem Shock will hold it in front of her and it will place down by itself. The totem will look something like the interception pylon from Apex Legends. To show the 15m radius it will have a blue line like lucio's aura.
 
Ability 3(Thunder Ball): Shock will shoot out a Lighting orb that deals 50 damage to enemies and will do 100 damage to shield health and barriers. This orb will go through enemies and barriers. This has a 8 second cooldown.

Animation:from Shock's left arm she will blast the thunder ball and the orb will look like Symmetra's old secondary fire.

Ultimate (Super Accelerant): Shock will have her own aura that has a 10m radius. Teammates in the radius get 20% faster ultimate charge, Shock moves 20% faster and she now has two charges of jolt.

Animation: Shock will charge up and say ""I'm fully charged!"". She now has blue and purple electricity radiating from her and there is a blue line around her representing her own aura.

Depending on what role I’m playing I ALWAYS try to counter him by hacking, sleeping, freezing, and stunning his ass. Like uppercut is so dumb because like you can’t move up in the air for like 2 seconds which gives him a chance to follow up with some shots and a punch in a wall. That’s another thing, when you get punched and get knocked back, if you even graze a wall, you just die. Even if the wall was so far away and you kind of just land there from the punch you still die. Don’t even get me started with Zarya bubbles on doom. I mean it’s literally game over if he keeps getting bubbled. He’s the reason I main Sombra, Brigitte, Pharah, and Mei just so I can make his life miserable. I also hate McCrees and Hanzos. His stun ability is stupid and I hate just dying out of nowhere from Hanzo arrows. At least with Widowmaker, you can see the shot line from where she’s shooting. Hanzo you have no idea where they are coming from. Winston can be really annoying especially when he gets pocketed by Ana and Zarya bubbling him.

249,Overwatch,"Take my post with a little salt, as I am not high ranked. Mid gold peak on one of my roles.


Blizzard is treating brig stun and mei freeze like shatter and sleep. Why is this wrong and their view is wack?

How to freeze as mei: look in their general direction and use primary fire
How to stun as brig: Look in their direction with your shield up and press primary fire.


How to stun as reinhardt: charge up your ULTIMATE and outplay the enemy tank/look for a good opportunity. Also has a cast time.

How to stun as Ana: Use a small hitbox projectile that requires a lot of aim and prediction. Also has a cast time. Not to mention if you touch them while they are slept, they wake up. They already shadow-nerfed it by removing the longer delay when they get up naturally.

And why is doom, someone with 3 CC's with one of them being a one shot ability not nerfed? 
""[He's] Mr. CC, CEO of Crowd Control Incorporated"" - Freedo


Sigma's rock is just a balance change imo, so it won't be included here.


When you get slept, do you think: ""dammit that was easy to pull off fuck ana she's op."" I'd hope not, because generally you would think something along the lines of: ""Dammit, she got me. Oh well."" Yes it's frustrating, but you should know that it is on a long cooldown, how much skill it takes to pull off, and how vulnerable Ana is without it.

Onto Rein's shatter. He builds it fast, I'll admit. But instead of making it harder for your teammates to follow up on it than it already is for them, just increase the ult cost. This also makes the shatter bomb combo slightly harder to pull off because dva bomb has a delay of 3 seconds before it explodes. Blizzard duration was already 5 seconds, (I'll get onto it's nerf later) and it was extremely easy to pull off and for mei all by herself to follow up on because of her range.


Brig nerfs: It's really not that big of a nerf, and it's still just as easy to follow up on.

Mei's nerf: KILL THE ICE WITCH KILL THE ICE WITCH. She has a one second stun as her primary fire, and a slow of 1 second (70% slow?) So this nerf she got was extremely necessary. Her ultimate now still lasts over 4 seconds, and is still easy to follow up on.

Mccree's nerf: Unnecessary. You can either FTH, which for some heroes is less effective than the two shots. Or, you can headshot and then bodyshot/headshot them, which requires skill to follow up on after the first shot. (Exceptions are baby dva and tracer, they require only one headshot)


Those are my 2 cents. Feel free to ignore them if you would like.",My Opinion on the new CC nerfs.

313,Overwatch,"As we all know, it’s common for teammates to trash talk each other, often saying things like “our DPS is trash!” after losing a game.  We’ve all been in games where your team gets rolled, and ya it sucks, but I hate it when people take it out on each other.  Even if they did suck, it’s not their fault unless they were intentionally throwing, which is usually not the case.  The matchmaking system grouped you up with them, they didn’t have a say in it.  They are ranked where they are because of their mistakes... if they didn’t make those kind of mistakes then they wouldn’t be ranked where they are now, and hence wouldn’t have been grouped with you.  And if you think you can pass that kind of judgement on a player without even analyzing the replay to see the game from their perspective, then I seriously doubt your quality of criticism.

Although I think throwing could be a problem, so maybe only give rewards if you actually win the game? Thoughts?

- Is the console (Xbox) or PC community for the game stronger/more popular/ more fun?
- Are there any versions cheaper than $60 for console? Only the PC seems to have a ""basic"" version. 
- Is the TF2--&gt;Overwatch skill boost a thing?

513,Overwatch,"later this afternoon we will be deploying changes to the experimental card (hopefully)

i wanted to give a little insight to the changes that we are trying. the term “crowd control” or “cc” is used to refer to abilities that heroes can do to other heros that cause them to lose control of their character. examples include mei’s ability to freeze you, reinhardt knocking you down with earthshatter or getting stuck in junkrat’s trap.

in overwatch, we need to walk a fine line with crowd control abilities. on the one hand, we are a highly competitive first person shooter. on the other hand, one of the defining things about overwatch is the fact that our heroes have amazing abilities and mobility. we understand that crowd control abilities can cause a lot of frustration. any time, control is taken away from you it generally doesn’t feel good.

so these experiments are targetted at certain heroes, specifically at their crowd control abilities, with the intent being that they will affect you less and have a lower overall impact on the game.

the one exception on this round of experiments is roadhog. we actually want to try to buff his ult a little bit to make it more impactful. it’s not as much of a pure buff as it might seem at first – while you will knock enemies back more, you’re also likely to push them out of damage more (unless you corner them).

internally, we have some bigger ideas about crowd control for overwatch 2 and are trying some experiments we are not able to bring to the experimental card (more fundarmental and larger changes).

we’ll see how this round goes and we’d love feedback. hopefully we can put some of these changes live if the test goes well.

I’m Dutch. Before Sigma was released, I never really imagined that any playable Dutch character would be in a major video game series. I’ve been playing games since I was very young and had never seen a Dutch character in a game that wasn’t made in the Netherlands, and certainly not one that was so well researched and respectful to my country and my culture. 

Sigma is very important to me, even though the only things we have in common are the language we speak and the country we come from. It’s his way of speaking, the Dutch proverbs and quips he uses, his Dutch voice lines, references to Dutch culture (such as Van Gogh and Escher in his sprays, or his karaoke voice line where he sings about “stroopwafels” [traditional Dutch syrup waffles]) and just everything about Sigma that is so familiar and comforting to me, even though he is a villain. It’s like home away from home, but in my favorite video game.

555,Overwatch,"It's been about a week of echo now, and I've logged several hours on her. A lot of you would agree that she's very fun...kit, ult, and all. However, I'm starting to see the heavy trend of echo players ulting into a third tank. Is anyone else feeling this is really oppressive to play against? I don't really even mind the ""extra life"" that echo gets when she ults, but when it's an entire tank's health pool, along with a fresh shield/set of cooldowns in basically any position you want, it can feel kind of hard to react to. I think ultimates \*should\* be strong, don't get me wrong. But, getting sandwiched by two Reinhardts is starting to get a little stressful.  


I heard a suggestion last night that maybe Echo should only be allowed to switch to DPS or supports? Considering the high ult charge rate, fresh set of cooldowns, and ""extra life"", I could see how that could be more balanced of an ultimate. My question is what are your thoughts?

567,Overwatch,"Honestly, i miss how toxic the overwatch games used to be. I played overwatch 2 years ago a lot and i just recently came back to it and its so different. I miss the days where losing immediately meant it was the snipers fault, so the rein decides to play super aggressive and then feeds and then rages over voice chat. That's what made this game so fun. Just messing around in voicechat added another level of entertainment to this game. Every so often a twelve year old would be yelling obscenities at you because you accidentally walled them off. Nowadays, no one seems to be in voice chat anymore. You could say just play with a group of friends, but its a different experience joking around with people you know and joking around with anonymous people bereft of respect. Honest to god, i miss the toxicity.

568,Overwatch,,"I am your shield, literally."
569,Overwatch,"Coming from a game in Paladins where tanks on average are typically a bit more mobile than OW, I think they have to be careful with this because it's tricky to balance because it's almost all or nothing. Either you can add mobility take away the shield and nerf damage making them mobile but useless to play or they're OP and terrorize the DPS and healers as off tanks, there's usually no in between. So maybe Passive mobility is the answer? 

I think every tank is going to need some form of mobility, there's a reason that Hammond, Diva, Winston(when meta) are extremely fun to play and popular, it's because they can move. I play a lot of Sigma and Orisa nowadays, but I hate it because I can't move any faster. I think there are ways around this, like every 10 seconds gain 15% movement speed for 3 seconds. Just something to make them more appealing and less frustrating. 

I think OW agenda to move away from shield dependency will need more mobility, Jeff said they don't want to make any more tanks with shields so unless rein changes he will always be required.",What can be done for tanks to generally be fun to play?

596,Overwatch,"Roles are good but I don't think that people should have separate SR for each role, I think that competitive mode should just limit heroes being picked to two of each category instead of forcibly locking the heroes. 

We could still queue up for a role and have the symbol next to our name indicating to the team what we would like to  play, but I think that ultimately it should be up to the players in each and every game to decide what their strengths and weaknesses are and coordinate with the team for the best hero picks possible for each round. 

If something isn't working then someone could swap roles with other people on the fly if needed. At the same time this would force the players who would go third or fourth dps before to just pick something else.  

It's not perfect but I think leaving it more to the hands of the players who were matched together is a better solution than forcibly locking roles and giving them different ranks. At the same time overall queue times will be lower, yes you might get a game with 5 dps mains and 3 of them will be forced to play a different role. At the same time though all you really need in this game is gamesense and aim.  You should be punished for not having one or the other, subsequently you should be able to play other roles to a decent degree to hold your rank.   

If you're having to wait 5 - 10 minute for any role at lower ranks silver / gold for example then there's something majorly wrong. That's where the playerbase is the MOST saturated, there should be very quick queue times at that rank. Being able to play a few games and getting a chance at playing your preferred role is better in my opinion than having to wait a long long time for a game that might just have a leaver anyways. At least you will be able to play the game and not be sitting there in queue. 

This is just my opinion and I might be wrong. I'm a support main. I play supports and only supports however I did have an account that was a DPS account ranked higher than my support account. I like playing multiple roles but I cant swap to dps when I feel like it because then I'll just be waiting more than I'm playing. I cant swap to tank mid-game if we want to try something new because we've been getting absolutely rolled in a match for example.  It's really driven me away from the game.

I understand players at the very highest ranks deal with long queue anyways as a product of the low amounts of players that can actually make it up there but I'm in platinum. I don't think I should have to wait 12 minutes for a queue time. 

So the question is would you rather have heroes locked to 2 of each kind but be able to swap between roles during the game or would you rather wait for a guaranteed shot at getting your role?",Role Queue Times

So if you do that and somehow fail and want to fall back and reenter there is no such a place for that to do and thus you instead have to wait for them to push their payload for a short distance before taking action which I feel is a bad thing if I have no choice but to give them free points before I can even do anything.,Not really liking how killing your enemies near their first spawn point as a defend team is not that rewarding at all

* Your two best supports, tanks and dps (that’s what I had in mind tbh).
* What team do you think has the best synergy.

So here goes for me, regardless of synergy, just my two best picks (and some bonus picks) at each position :

**Supports :**

* Lucio.
* Mercy.  
*Bonus pick :* all of them except Moira cause no way I’m touching the most boring hero to play in the game.

**Tanks :**

* Reinhardt.
* Winston.

819,Overwatch,"So lately OW has been lagging for me to the point it’s just unplayable. 

I am on a gen 1 Xbox, I know it’s not my internet cause it runs fine, I am only one on it and i just moved so I’ve tried 2 different setups/providers. I average 60-80 ping. I don’t understand how I lag under 100 ping. Abilities visually show as doubles examples: double beat drops, double ash dynamites. Winston’s will jump up and freeze mid air for split second. I feel like the feedback from my inputs don’t work like they should. A new player may not notice difference but everything about the game is off. Feels like 15fps. It’s quite bad.

Is it my old Xbox? Xbox live servers? OW servers? I know everyone is staying home quarantined is this the reason?

I am GM lucio main, my wall rides don’t always register and queueing for a game is basically just throwing other people’s games. A couple months ago it was running fine.

Any advice or similar experience would be helpful. (Yes console omegalul I know)",Xbox performance issues. Help

824,Overwatch,"So, I’m not even a high elo for my damage section at high platinum and it takes around 10 minutes or so to find a game. Which I understand since that’s what everyone wants to play. However, I’m not cool with it when someone isn’t playing and the game gets cancelled. Then you have to wait the entire queue time again. This has been happening more frequently to me now than ever.  

Imagine being a even higher elo damage and having your games cancelled just to be forced to wait again. I think overwatch should add some kind of system that gives those people who’s games got cancelled first dibs into the next game. Nobody likes a game where they never get to play. 

I’m sure this has been mentioned and am wondering if anyone has heard anything about it.","Why, just why"

Roadhog can take 900 damage before dying because of his snuffing ability, and Hamster can take even more if he uses his shield ability well.

The difference is they’re huge and easy to hit and don’t do that much damage, while Echo is a tiny robot who can fly around, requiring the opposing team to play hitscan and destroying them if they can’t aim well.

What a broken character.

P.S. when she glides she’s also like Pharah if Pharah always had an amped Lucio speedboost.","Shower thought: Imagine if Roadhog had a tiny hitbox, did way more damage, and could fly. That’s Echo"

I’m not quite sure if this is the right subreddit, but It can’t be way off. So just for knowledge, I’m an Overwatch Player since season 1, but had a pause for around 2 years now.

939,Overwatch,"When you start taking responsibility and fixing your mistakes and upgrading your gameplay, you will inevitably climb, regardless of how your teammates do. Your teammates, like yourself, will inevitably make mistakes, you can't avoid that, regardless of elo (OW pro players make mistakes. NBA players make mistakes). the only thing you can actually control are your own actions and mindset

1. Play confidently regardless of how you're doing. Sometimes it's easy to lose hope, but always have a rock solid belief in yourself that you can carry the game regardless of position in the game. That belief will take you far, as you will play 10x better with that confidence.
2. Take lessons from every game. every game has a wealth of wisdom to learn from. you can learn about matchups versus different characters, how to position better, how to engage better, how to use your ults better, learn about different synergies. all of this information will make your gameplay better
3. Believe in your potential to climb. notice if you have any limiting beliefs like ""i'm just a hard stuck person"" or, ""this ranking is all I deserve"" because those beliefs become self-fulfilling prophecies.
4. Imagine what it is that you want. You want to get to diamond? well get clear on that, imagine it and work towards it
5. don't underestimate coaching. there are top 500 coaches on Fiverr that for just $15/hr will help you climb. i paid for it twice, and i climbed from silver to plat the first call and from plat to diamond the second call (note just because you purchase a call doesn't mean you are automatically going to climb. you need to implement, work hard and go for for your goals)
6. play confidently in general. playing meek, uncertain and insecure is a surefire way of losing. how are you going to win if you're not making plays? you're expecting your team to carry, instead of the other way around
7. if you've tilted real hard take a break. it's okay to take breaks and come back into the game when your mind is fresh. for me - taking a break resets my mindset if i've tilted
8. look at games as opportunities to just improve on your skill. instead of thinking about your ranking and getting scared of losing SR, look at the big picture and know that losses are inevitable if you've learned and gotten better from each loss, you've not actually lost - you've gained and as your skill goes up, you will inevitably start winning
9. mechanical skill is important but it's definitely only one factor. game sense, mechanical skill and confidence are the three pillars in my opinion
10. analyze these insights, think for yourself and don't take these insights on blind faith. just test them out and see how they work. like a fun experiment ",When you stop blaming your teammates that's when you'll climb

The huge benefit is that you'll for sure have tanks/supports/DPS that are your rank.


I play support, my highest rank on support was Plat. However, if I want to branch out to another role or switch roles completely for a season, I'll have to play sub optimally for my rank. So I may be a Silver tank playing in Plat and have to lose a few games before it balances it out. 


So you won't have a Gold support who got tired of it playing like a  bronze DPS on your team when you're in Gold, you'll have a Gold DPS who has consistently stayed at that rank on that role. If you win every game as a support but lose every game as tanks, but play support 70% of the time and tanks 30% of the time, those 30% of games won't be throws because you'll queue up in a lower rating.


In summary, now you'll be able to rely more on your own skills in game than those of your teammates. ""DPS aren't doing anything"", well congrats! They're in the SAME rank as you so you are just as bad as them, so you need to learn how to play your role better to win games because everyone is where they should be. 


TL;dr: People will not be filling into roles where they play at a lower level than what there SR is when playing on their better roles",One of the huge benefits of Role Lock is that you'll for sure have teammates who deserve to be in the same rank as you

1057,Overwatch,"Firstly I would like to point out I love this game but I hate how I have to pray to rngesus every comp game, to get good team mates. By that I don't mean to have people who are on my team who just are great at their heroes. I would just like a team who wishes to work together. Its beyond frustrating trying to climb or even have good matches( regardless of match result ). More often than not you have team mates who exhibit the follow negative behaviours:-

&amp;#x200B;

\- No interest in communication.

\- Insta lock a hero and stay on there, no matter who the opponent is.

\- Accuse you of being toxic for trying to suggest anything that would help the team.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think increasing the avoid list is the answer. Because it doesn't solve the fundamental issue of how players play/communicate.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the current endorsement system doesn't actually do anything. Like I actually don't understand the purpose for it. It currently, yes praises fellow team mates, provides exp and loot boxes. I'm pretty sure most people just use it for the exp and loot boxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why can't we have something in place where we have a system that actually puts people who don't actually want to work together as a team ( and the other things mentioned above) to be placed in a negative team pool of players. For sure this would actually encourage people to start working together.

1060,Overwatch,"So I had the most interesting match in competitive. At the hero select screen, someone picked Lucio and realized we needed a tank. And I said this outload as I was on team chat. Username Chipper something said "" you want Lucio?"" and I replied ""if it's ok"". Mind you I main Lucio and Orisa. I can flex lol so have gave me Lucio. Were on the Lijang maps and 2 mins in it's a good battle. Chipper the Junkrat starts to be a sore loser saying ""omg what the hell dude, here we go again"". Mind you it's a good match and very competitive. We still were doing well and I was like ""dont worry we got this"". I'm usually a level headed player and dont give up after 2% of the point after the enemy team is capping it lol this dude had no confidence I swear.

Then throughout the rounds, he was reaching his final form of toxicity and just being a dumb dumb. Saying stuff like ""are you that happy go lucky guy?""
""Bro you're a trash Lucio"" (ended up with 14k healing so yeah I'm trash) ""dude this team is trash"".
Again it was 1-1...uhmm we still have a shot lol. During the last match, our Reaper joined team chat and started to play the Barney song ""I love you"". I was in tears laughing as our team was messing around while straight up destroying the enemy team. I dont wanna say it was because of my positivity or just leadership and shot calling but as far as I'm concerned; the team only got better and better and just straight up murdered the enemy team the last round. Chipper the Junkrat was the only toxic player.

At the end of the match, we obviously win, and he threw a tantrum and acted like we lost. And I say myself as a card with my 14k healz i said ""man i didnt do anything did i?"" And just to also remind you 5 outta 6 players on our team were on fire in the last 2 rounds.

1062,Overwatch,"2-2-2 Role lock has been something of a hot topic for a moment now. There was a lot of discussion and speculation surrounding it for a while, and now it seems more likely than ever that it really will be a thing: at the very least, for the pros in OWL.

I've seen a lot of people in favor of it, believing that it will change gameplay for the better, as it helps deal with comps like GOATS and keeping matches arguably more even. Jeff Kaplan said a few months back that 2-2-2 role lock would make the game much easier to balance and that he believes it'd solve some issues with the game. 

On the other hand, a lot of people also seem to really not like it, for reasons like the loss of team composition creativity / flexibility and how it could affect certain heroes who seem to shine more in non-2-2-2 comps (e.g. Brig, Moira).

It's kind of going to be like a more limited mystery heroes, and maybe (not quite as much if the team itself isn't 2-2-2, see below) become a good way to acclimate players to roles they aren't used to, with the incoming role lock.

As the game starts, each player on a team is locked into a random role. Whether the overall distribution on the team is actually 2-2-2 or random also, I haven't decided, the latter would be more 'wacky' for arcade though, so I'd probably favor that.

But no worries about balance, because both teams will have the exact same role distribution. Maybe both teams are forced to run 4 tanks 2 damage, for example.

Other than that, same as quick play.

For the purpose of this experiment, imagine that each character is on a course best suited for each of their movement abilities.

Also dont include ults as they wouldn't charge fast enough without enemies anyway.

Example: A straight course for Soldier's run, D.Va boosters, Reinhardt charges, Hanzo leaps and Gengi dashes, walls for lucio, hammond and widow to use, walls for Ashe and pharah to fire behind them, etc.

Without doing any math, my gut says the characters with the most consistent high base speeds (lucio, soldier, hammond and gengi) will take the top spots, but there's a possibility some movement abilities that are on cooldowns but cover greater distance would make up for it (Winston, tracer, doomfist, sombra, etc.)

The Developers have been and are still working hard on fixing Doomfist's issues. Over the course of Doomfist’s lifespan in the game he has had more bug fixes than there have been patches to the game as a whole. They have listed a literal shitton of fixes over the course of his existence in the game, [82 to be exact](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t-4jbK4cY-e4tCRSj8STaKVpD_5DaH9zjMuYcmR_kjc/edit#) *~~(It took so long to skim through all the notes, some of the most recent ones are a right mess)~~*.

Though the combined efforts of many, many Doomfist Mains we have yet again compiled all of Doomfist’s bugs into one giant ass list for both community and developer awareness. The last post I made regarding his bug list was ***11 months ago*** and there were well over 40 bugs to his name. Since then a couple bugs have been fixed but an almost equal amount of new ones have popped up or “unpatched themselves”. This updated list is sitting pretty on 42 active bugs and features a grade in severity and ease of replication on a scale of 1 to 5.

**Severity**

|1|2|3|4|5|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Effectively No Gameplay Impact|A Little Impactful (Minor Annoyance)|Situational Gameplay Impact|Very Impactful on General Gameplay|Potentially Game Changing Outcomes|

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Recreate-able on Your Own, Anywhere|Easy and Reliable to Recreate|Recreate-able Under Certain Conditions|Incredibly Difficult to Purposely Recreate|Almost Impossible to  Purposely Recreate|

Anybody reading can also join the [Doomfist Mains Discord](https://discord.gg/8xeryfR), we seek and figure out how most of these bugs work here, give newer players tips and tricks and seek new ways to use the mechanics at hand to play Doomfist. Our bug chat is also regularly updated with more bug clips, info, etc. We seriously get \~2-5 new clips a day.

**The Multi-Punch**

This bug may have been around since Doomfist’s launch into the game, however it has not been reported or encountered to our knowledge until now. Doomfist can stalemate a charging Rein, another punching Doomfist &amp; bashing Brig with Rocket Punch, however if another enemy occupies the same space as the stalemating enemy Doomfist can both land the Rocket Punch on one hero and stalemate the other. We only have 2 clips of this and replication is quite hard. We are unsure if it is possible with another Doomfist or a Brigitte as both clips involve Reinhardt.

Bouncers are considered to be the new breed of sliders. Sometimes punched characters outright bounce off of surfaces where they are supposed to impact or even slide on them. These started becoming more frequent around 2 patches before Storm Rising and are still very frequent now.

**Questionable Impacts**

This bug acts as a complete opposite to Sliders. Punched enemies can impact walls that are seemingly outside of the 45º limit for wall impacts. For those unaware the developers cleared up the confusion around wall impacts way back when they fixed it just never impacting and [gave a reference for the angle of impact requirements.](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759527400#post-1)

Our working theory to these questionable impacts is:

*Prior movement affects the trajectory angle at the moment of the punches impact with the enemy.* ie, You punch someone in a corridor, they strafe left to avoid but the punch still connects and they impact the wall next to you on a seemingly 90˚ angle.

The problem is this doesn’t entirely hold up as testing proved fruitless regarding replication, but this is the best we have and seems to line up with the clips provided...

**Rocket Punch vs. Translocator**

This interaction has been around for quite some time but has not exactly been noted by anyone. Translocator should interact with Rocket Punch the same way Symmetra's Turrets would however it does not. Translocator outright stops Doomfist in his tracks if he hits it and Doomfist cannot punch it on flat ground the way he can with everything else.

When 2 Rocket Punches collide they are meant to stalemate and knock both Doomfist’s to the ground, however there are cases where this does not happen and 1 of 2 other interactions happen.

**1:** Both Doomfist’s punch each other and knock each other back.

**2:** One Doomfist Punches the Other and outright negates his Rocket Punch.

It is not known what causes this irregularity. The latter result is much rarer than the former so we unfortunately don’t have footage of it.

**Rocket Punch Stall**

As of a recent patch (it is unclear which exactly) this bug has made a resurgence. Doomfist’s Rocket Punch gets “stalled” on geometry. It is unclear what exactly the cause of this is and a reliable replication method is yet to be found.  
*Note: When I say it's made a resurgence, I don't mean it's unpatched itself, this issue used to be kinda prominent then just kinda stopped... No patch notes, no mention, no nothin.*

# SEISMIC SLAM BUGS

**Seismic Slam No-Reg     \[ALLEGEDLY FIXED ON PTR\]**

This bug was heavily attributed to the way Slam functions, however that was changed with the Anniversary patch then patched again with the Baptiste Challenge and now allegedly again on the PTR. Here's hoping this time it actually works. For the sake of this bugs history and how many times it has been patched I will keep it on this list. Here's hoping this is the last patch it needs!

**Seismic Slams “Linger Effect”   \[NOT A BUG\]**

Due to how Seismic Slam work before the Anniversary update there would always be a lingering effect as the ability worked, however this is not the case anymore and while this isn’t necessarily a bug that aspect of Seismic Slam was an integral part to how Doomfist players played around certain situations.

It would be nice to have this integrated back while maintaining the benefits of the new Slam and given they are effectively the same mechanic I would like to lobby for this to be applied to Reinhardt’s Earthshatter too.

**Seismic Slam Targeting Locations: Death Pits!**

There are certain maps where Doomfist’s Targeted Slam can target Dive directly into Death Pits. I don’t exactly need to explain that any further, it can be quite detrimental to players if they suddenly fly into a pit instead of the ledge they were looking at.

There are instances where Seismic Slams reticle will be placed on a surface, the button will be pressed and nothing will happen even though there is nothing preventing the ability from carrying out. This variant only affects Dive Slam.

It is unknown what the cause of this issue is or how exactly to replicate it, however it is an incredibly frustrating bug to deal with.

**Incorrect Slam Indicators**

Reported in the 40+ Bugs megathread. This is caused by activating Seismic Slam during the couple frames where it transitions from a Dive Slam to an Arc Slam. This can more often than not kill a Doomfist or completely negate an initiation. The Developers have acknowledged this and are working to improve upon the interaction, however I would still like to present a grade given how common this interaction is.

*Sorry I’m lacking video examples of this particular bug, they’re effectively an accepted shitty part of general gameplay at this point and are quite hard to find when looking back at footage :/*

**The Heroes are Floors!**

Slam considers other heroes as floor when it comes to deciding what version of slam to output, a Ground Slam or a Dive Slam.

The only deciding factor in choosing which version of Slam to output should be the altitude from the floor, ignoring other heroes.

It is unclear exactly if this interaction is a bug or not, however recently some keen eyed Doomfist players have noticed the damage numbers on Seismic Slam’s UI behaving a little strangely.

Rising Uppercut is supposed to lift both players up a predetermined height unless they hit some geometry along the way or use a mobility ability, however there are cases where Uppercut simply does not follow this rule and enemies will stop short, throwing off the Doomfist’s followup attacks. It appears to occur as a weird bi-product of Uppercutting a Rolling McCree however cases involving other heroes have allegedly happened.

**Hacked In Meteor Strike**

There is a brief window of opportunity where a Sombra can Hack Doomfist as he enters Meteor Strike.

**CC vs Meteor Strike Casting**

This bug is a little strange. Hard Stuns can cancel Meteor Strike in its casting phase even if it seems like it shouldn’t. *(This interaction in itself needs some fine tuning and more explaining btw please)* As recently discovered, knockbacks and other non-stun forms of CC can also affect Meteor Strike during its casting phase.

**Meteor Strike, Terrain Differences, Ledges &amp; Death Pits (4 in 1 Bug)**

This bug can be counted as a 4-in-1 as there are multiple different interactions regarding Meteor Strike and ledges, height differences in terrain, death pits, etc. The different variations will be marked in their examples and explanations.

**Variation 1**

One of the most notable ones is where Meteor Strike will straight up incorrectly place its lading reticle. A decent chunk of these issues are related to some very strange and questionable places Meteor Strike can land.

**Variation 2**

It can also be partially attributed to the general scaling issues Meteor Strike has, when near walls or higher surfaces Meteor Strikes reticle can jump up to them similar to how a player could, however there are areas around the game where this seemingly does not apply correctly and the reticle can scale vertical surfaces. This aspect has been acknowledged by the developers and requires more fixing.

**Variation 3**

Meteor Strike will land close to a ledge over a death pit and not deal any damage whatsoever. There is seemingly no reason this should occur given where the landing reticle is.

**Variation 3 Examples**

* [This footage demonstrates it slightly differently but it is still the same bug](https://youtu.be/r8jjNLdQqn8)
* [This footage is very recent](https://youtu.be/iW4fmFfsUYo)

&amp;#x200B;

**Variation 4**

Finally regarding low ledges, bridges, etc, Meteor Strike will not correctly scale the top down view to its appropriate landing zone. The landing zone will be under the higher surface however the reticle and the top-down view will display on the higher surface and vice versa. It is difficult to tell where the landing zone will be in these cases.

# MAP ISSUES

**Breakable Railings**

For some reason Doomfist cannot consistently punch through any railings anymore. This has been an inconsistency on exclusively Rialto for a while now but was made worse/more noticeable with the Storm Rising update and has since become an all map inclusive issue with the Anniversary Update.

**Breakable Railings 2: To Break or Not to Break?**

Railings are supposed to act as walls for Rocket Punch impacts, however it is very inconsistent. The amount impacts railings can take ranges from zero to seemingly infinite and there is no clear reason why. It can potentially mean the difference between getting a vital pick and dying. Either the railings should be like walls for all impacts or they should break outright.

# UNSPECIFIED/ISOLATED ISSUES

**Knocking a Mech into Death Pits**

Now that D.Va’s Mech can be knocked around by Rocket Punch during Self Destruct a new bug has emerged. When a Self Destructing Mech is punched into a death pit Doomfist will get massive damage indicators as if he is perpetually damaging the mech in the pit. Doomfist gains no ult charge for this “damage” dealt to the mech.

I discovered this on accident while testing another bug. I thought it to be exclusive to Rocket Punch &amp; Mech during Self-Destruct until I watched a Brandito Stream where the same thing happened but from his Uppercut.

A patch for this issue did go through on the 18th of June. However the clip we have provided was captured a couple days ago. Given the circumstances and the lack of more than just 1 clip we're thinking this could just be an isolated incident, however since it was recent it is still relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I wrap up I would like to touch upon the state of Doomfist’s interactions with geometry around the game in general. However the game is laid out at the moment isn’t particularly helpful for Doomfist, hence the glaring existence of Sliders and Bouncers. If something can be changed to accomodate more for Doomfist so he can be more consistent; widen the angle of wall impacts, re-jig the geometric layout, add something to him, etc. We don’t particularly care what happens, as long as he can be more consistent and less of a frustrating gamble to play.

I was able to do it and honestly it works amazing. The only slight problem is that when you suicide as the lowest level (McCree) you go down a point and stay as McCree. So you have to get 2 kills before moving on. If you want to use this setting just copy what I did. Honestly this should be in the original hero gauntlet and I would appreciate it if you could help that happen.

1233,Overwatch,"Hello,

Recently, I've been experiencing some issues playing Competitive. I built a new PC a couple months ago with a Ryzen 5 1600 and RTX 2060, and have only ever experienced this issue with my new rig. 

Basically, my screen will freeze up and become unresponsive at a random point during a competitive match. The only message I get is a window that says ""Rendering Device Lost"". The only thing I've been able to do from that point on is restart my PC, relaunch Overwatch, and try to rejoin before I am kicked for from the match. I've played lots of arcade and quickplay, mainly to test to see if the issue occurs during those modes, however from what I can tell, it always happens during Comp only. 

I've looked online and haven't found much help (just a lot of other frustrated people, all of whom seem to own an RTX graphics card), so I was wondering if anyone would be able to provide any other kind of useful information. This issue only happens with Overwatch, I can play many other games which are certainly more graphically demanding just fine without crashing or freezing. Also, I thought that there may be some weird issue with the higher graphics presets, so I turned my settings down to low and medium, however I still received the same ""Rendering Device Lost"" message.

&amp;#x200B;

It's really frustrating to not be able to play competitive, out of fear that I will drop SR and get banned for being disconnected and also I hate to put my teammates through short handed situations where they almost always will lose. If anyone can provide any information that helps, I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks!","""Rendering Device Lost"" Crash"

The first instance I noted, the enemy team was slowly pushing and had failed to touch the cart even though they certainly could have. Everyone in our teams voice chat was surprised (albeit pleasantly so) as ""Victory"" flashed on screen, all thinking from the audio cue that there was a couple seconds left in the round.

Since that moment, I've had two other games where the cue was distinctly off, once causing the enemy team to neglect touching, and once causing my team to. Both times my team ended up surprised in the voice chat.

Here's the audio that plays:

I'm running the game on disc on an xbox one x over ethernet cable, xbox elite controller and a wired headset, my buddy in the same house on a standard xbox one identical set up otherwise and gets the same issue from time to time.

4. Both Mei and Sym can inflict severe movement penalties on you with their abilities. Unless you really know what you're doing, you just might as well concede...

1400,Overwatch,"Locked 2-2-2 will overall be a major positive in my opinion. It is the most optimal experience in game that fits all modes and all levels of play. 

The game so heavily relies on Tank and Healing that not having these, can often lead to games that are just rough, especially if the enemy team does run some tanks and healers. This is why the change can be great. 

Everyone is bound to the same parameters meaning it’s going to be down to coordination and skill that wins you a match, now that everyone is forced to play 2-2-2. I like this and I genuinely think it’s only a positive. 

As for every mode, I feel overall matches are gonna feel more fair and fun. It also means that whatever you wanna try in quickplay (composition-wise) you can transfer that over to Comp as the rules all apply. 

I think a big rebalancing will be needed but that’s fine. I think many people probably won’t want this, but I’d personally would at least like to see it tested in all modes",Locked 2-2-2 should come to all base modes of the game; both Quick play and competitive (as well as OWL of course)

1424,Overwatch,"I was low silver ranking up pretty steadily last summer, playing with a regular trio, winter got silly busy for me and I'm getting back into regular play. This last season has really hurt me and I've dropped to high bronze. For the last week I've dropped even farther as the season is finishing off, mostly because I've been trying to new heros in comp and figure I can't get any lower (and even losses my SR hasn't changed). The trio I was with is now high gold so we don't run together now. I love this game, but having a rough time getting out of ELO hell.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a flex player, focus on Phara, Anna, Lucio, Orisa. (Anna my worst of the four, but the one I'm practicing the most) My aim is pretty decent, game sense could use improvement. I communicate, but that seems to be the problem, no one is talking on Xbox these days in solo queue. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what I'm looking for are like minded bronze players looking to get out of bronze and into silver for next season. I'm typically playing weeknights from 9-10:30pm MST and most Saturdays from 10pm until I can't keep my eyes open anymore.

1453,Overwatch,"Now that everyone is talking about 2-2-2 lock, I think that it’s a good time to discuss hero selection in overwatch for random queues. The method that currently exists was always unfair and created more toxicity than needed. 

They need a system like APEX legends which pretty much solved this.  They did a lot wrong but one thing they have right is the legend selection process and jump master, to put it simply it is just fair, everyone is treated equally. 

When you join a match, you are placed in a random pick order. You don’t get to pick your class or hero until it is your turn. If 2 other guys already picked DPS, you must pick tank or healer. If someone already picked your instalock hero, you must pick a different one. 

A timer runs down for you to pick a hero in the order you were placed. 

If you do not pick you are sent to the back of the line, maybe there is a pass option (you might do this because you are AFK, or you just want to fill. 

Now OW can mix it up and make it even more fair. 

Next round a new order is selected perhaps in reverse order to make it fair. First person last round picks last this time. 3rd round the order is inverted or something. You can come up with all sorts of order solutions. 

For instance (letters indicate players)

Round 1 ABCDEF

Round 2 FEDCBA

Round 3 CBAFED  
 Round 4 DEFABC

Round 5 BADCFE

Round 6 EFCDAB

This system might even give spectators some excitement for OWL, who are they going to pick !!!!!

Once you pick a hero then you are locked into that heros role for the duration of the round. You may switch to a different hero that is available but not to a different class of heros.",2-2-2 lock solutions hero pick solutions for competitive.

1471,Overwatch,[removed],Who’s your favorite hero and why
1472,Overwatch,"Learn which heroes counter others and stop sticking to your same ‘main’ pick when you’re being ran over. So often is the tendency to blame everyone else in this game, or just quit the game and leave everyone else screwed, rather than to stop and take an objective look at why you are losing so hard and what you can do about it... coz there is something you can do.

Quick few examples: 

- Pharah flying around uncontested destroying your team, but you only play junkrat? Switch to a soldier and put some pressure on her. Doesn’t matter if your aim is terrible, playing Pharah and having to deal with bullets being fired at you is not easy.

- Weecking Ball, Doomfist, Hog or (on a rare occasion) Tracer ruining your backline? Firstly, realise that’s what’s going on - stop going on your mad flanks and realise that your support and tanks are get bashed about - then switch to a Mei or Sombra and CC the hell out of them. Again, it’s so much fun playoff Ball when nobody is stopping you... but you moment you start getting focus hacked is the moment your game gets ruined and you start leaving your team down a man.

- Pharah and Soldier can sometimes do pretty well against a pesky Bastion. So stop shouting down your mic to ‘do something about the Bastion’ coz you keeping gets deleted as Genji, and switch.

- Moira completely annihilates an aggressive Genji. 

- Jump a monkey onto a Widow with good aim.

- Playing Reinhard and Bastion is deleting your shield? Stop shouting at your DPS and switch to something more useful. An Orisa can at least shoot the annoying robot. Your big German tank is just a walking ult-charge for the enemy team once his shield is gone.

So, yeh. Just because your team gets rolled on the first point, doesn’t mean you should throw in the towel and blame everyone else. Learn how to change and adapt. Stop stubbornly one-tricking. It doesn’t matter how good you are on your hero, if you’re getting destroyed, there is a hero that is probably better in the current situation you are in.

Just my two cents from observations recently.",Quick General Tip
1473,Overwatch,"It’s silly as well because I have been called a smurf which I’m not. The term smurf and calling people it is starting to be overused. It’s a problem but idk I’m ok at the game but obviously some people think I’m plat or diamond, when truthfully I have never gotten out of gold.",Smurfing
1474,Overwatch,,"New to Orisa, does pull not cancel Mercy res?"
1475,Overwatch,"OWL seems to have its own problems related to comp due to the synergy they can create as an organized team. They're taking advantage of mathematical formulas to maximize a chess game of ultimates by hyper coordinating teamwork, positioning, cooldown usage, etc. Re-working, re-balancing, and re-tooling heroes to alter this can only go so far without upsetting the general gameplay of Overwatch. I get it. Role Queue might just be the only way for OWL to get by this.

But for general gameplay from Silver through Diamond, GOATS *isn't* a thing. And many reasons for people wanting Role Lock in Comp are for reasons different from what OWL is going through. People want Role Lock to prevent 4 DPS teams. OW is implementing role lock because they WANT DPS on the teams.

In a perfect world, I think general public Comp needs 1 kind of role lock: 1-MT, 4-Flex, 1-MH.

For the absolute most consistent possible gameplay without completely handcuffing comp variety and strategy, there needs to always be a Main Tank (Rein, Orisa, Winston, Hammond) and a Main Heal (my definition of a Main Heal here is someone who can reliably keep the tank's health up at a 'fast' pace). Specifically, Ana, Moira, Baptiste. Lucio, Zenyatta, Brig, and Mercy are ""off"" heals if only because their rate of healing isn't enough to sustainably keep a Tank up through general focus fire and teamfights.

Now, obviously it's best to have 2-tanks and 2-healers in most cases. But games are certainly still winnable when you're solo tanking as a MT or solo-healing with one of the healers I mentioned above. What is NOT consistent is 2 off-tanks or 2-off heals. Please don't misunderstand what I'm saying. It's obviously possible to win. It's technically possible to win with 6 DPS. What I'm trying to emphasize is *consistent* gameplay.

You will not generate consistent teamfights and gameplay with 2 off tanks or 2 off healers. You *will* have a semblance of consistent teamplay with a Main Tank and Main Healer.  I hope this is a sentiment that is shared throughout the community and will spread into the game.","I hope 2-2-2- doesn't make it to public Comp, here's why"

1496,Overwatch,"I don't think many people ever thought about this, but you probably remember how the whole game was based on hero stacking on every queue back on launch, including comp (i.e. played like no limits Arcade mode). It didn't take long for the devs to realize the game was completely broken that way, so they removed hero stacking from comp. Shortly after, they decided to remove it from quick play aswell (just so you know how unplayable the state of the game was heading to, it was super early and everyone was still a noob).


Now think about it, they've worked for several years on a project, which the core is the PvP and being able to repeat heroes was a huge part of it, only so their design was proved to be disastrous a few weeks after the game going live. I personally had 0 faith in a design team like that. Titan didn't work out because of design issues and everything was pointing the same for Overwatch, except that it was launched instead of cancelled.


So I'm glad simply removing hero stacking was a fix good enough to stabilize the game's design. But I'm glad they took more steps and fixed the whole offense vs defense thing that also clearly didn't fit the game's design, and reworked heroes that were originally designed for defense only. I personally still think we need an extra category for UI and clarity purposes, but everything is looking much better now. 


I see many people complaining about the current state of the game but honestly, for me it's on its peak. It was much much worse back in 2016 and 2017 when you look at the game from a design perspective.","In the light of Overwatch's state discussions, I'm actually glad the game flourished despite its weird start"

I'm training with Mcree since the update and I feel like I've improved somehow but I need to learn a lot. I've practised using code P3PZC for aerial aim setting soldier, reaper and mcree bots and I think I got more consistent shots on pharahs in casual games, and somehow when people jump I can aim easier than before. I also use the Paris aim training with Lucios, flying Anas and blinking Zen, I train flicking with Zen and practice tracking and stun headshot combo with Lucios.

When I feel I warmed up I go to the Havana Arena FFA aim train and I feel better everytime, depending on who's in the lobby obviously.

But when I go to matches I cant aim as good, I fail even jumping monkeys after me or roadhogs in front of me. I know I need to improve my aim, and above all I need to hit more headshots, I can get silver medal and gold medal on damage and kills, but I barely headshot in casual games.

1547,Overwatch,"Hey everyone! So my friend and I started to play Overwatch. And he likes playing healers and I like tanks. TBH we were kind of forced into the role since we always have like 4 players going DPS haha. Anyways I was wondering if y’all know of any good tank/healer (pocket healer) duo comps? If it’s even viable?


If not, what do you guys think about Tank/DPS or Heal/DPS duo? 

With my thinking is that with a shield we can dish out a lot of damage using Osiris shield since  I can attack with it out.  And his thinking is that with a healer the chances of dying is very slim.",Role duos?

She can just go invisible and translocate in and out at will, and to be honest Im really starting to get annoyed of how cheap a character she is.

She is TAKING OVER the Overwatch League as her pickrate is through the roof right now. Even with GOATS being the goto comps. Sombra fits in GOATS and also does very well against it.

I really think Sombra needs a TIMER back on her Translocater, being able to be unlimited invisible and unlimited time on translocator makes it SO EASY FOR HER to get in the backline and use EMP and then get back with her team to attack. And there is NO WAY to counter this other than Widowmakers Ult. And an ULT vs an unlimited ability the time ratio is just way on Sombra's side.

Having 2 ablities be unlimited is just too much and it makes it to easy for Sombra to attack at the right time.

I got into competitive more recently, as a total I have 69 hours of competitive and 475 hours quick play.

My current SR is 995.

I have decided my tank will always be Orisa, my damage will always be Reaper.

I don't like having too many characters, as I tend to get confused.

Now here's where things get tricky:  

I'm good at Mercy and Moira.  But I'm not sure which I'm better at, not sure how to find out. 

And even still, from what I understand it's very, very hard to climb with them.

So I've been working on Ana.

Even though I'm not quite as strong with her, as I understand it if I get proficient enough with her I can climb more effectively. 

I really want to just commit to Moira, Mercy, or Ana permanently so I don't have to worry about knowing multiple healers.

How should I choose?  Is one flat-out better than the other?(from what I've heard, this is not the case)

3 heroes per year is too slow and making the game feel very repetitive and dull.

&amp;#x200B;

but i guess just having 3 heroes per year is good enough for them.

literally the reason why overwatch can not be league.

league 5 to 6 champs per year no matter what.",5 heroes per year
1742,Overwatch,,Send me your clips
1743,Overwatch," I think the best solution so far, imo, is to have 3 players be locked to a role, scrap the separate SR thing, you can queue as a tank, dps, support, flex, or fill (which means you just fill for the team), each role you queue in you have to pick the heroes in that role only, flex has the whole roster available to them.

Flex players must actually flex and if let's say 4 teammates ban them they can get punished for not actually doing what benefits the team, which means flex players have an obligation to try and do what's best for the team and not insta-lock and be greedy, this means each game you are guaranteed to have a support and tank.

Queue times for each role would be half as long technically because you need half the amount of players to fill each role, I think that most players will gravitate to flex but there will be hidden gems which go for a specific role, those players are expected to carry the game

There could be a problem if a huge number  of players pick fill which means that they can get a role that they are not very good at, that could be a problem, but this can be combated by making a career profile overhaul, giving you a rank for each hero and showing your top 3, the way they calculate how good you are at a certain hero is that they weigh your performance against each player in the ladder, showing a percentage, if you are more than 50% you are above average, above average in terms of stats, the game takes your average accuracy, ability usage and ultimate charge to see how well you do in each category, if you maximize your dps, ability cooldowns, and accuracy your percentage would be higher in terms of hero rank, which means that players who flex have an obligation to atleast play their top 3 heroes or heroes that are needed and they are good at, if they want to only play a dps one day and don't want players telling them to switch, they can queue for dps.

This whole system is not forcing certain 2 2 2 compositions and allows for more room for crazy strategies without fully breaking the game, another part is that mid game you can swap roles with another player in spawn (if not it can be between rounds), both players must agree to swap, so if a healer wants to go tank he can swap roles with a flex play or the tank player to play tank, if you queue for a role it should say in all caps that you are expected to be the main tank, main heal, or main dps, not a utility dps or a flanker, flex players are going to be more targetted for gameplay sabotage and ruining games because they have the power to switch to any hero and if the team needs another healer and they are picking whatever they feel, they should be punished.  
 

I am open for criticism, debates and any problems that may arise with this, there may be a huge flaw in my system that I am not seeing, I just thought of this a minute ago and just wanted to write it, I thought what if there is only one of each role enforced and the rest being flex, how can it function and be playable.","Role Lock Queue, My Optimal Solution / career profile overhaul suggestions"

1751,Overwatch,"Hello, my name is Tiob and i play 2 years in Overwatch. The problem is 'bout Competitive play, and i wanna take it and share with u. Since i started playing Overwatch competitives i was like a casual player, but then when i tried to find some overwatch community stuffs like finding top channels on youtube and be active on  it. When i saw for the first time players from grandmaster ranks i just dreamed to be like they. Overwatch was my first esport game, and my first rank was silver by then i dropped couse playing with my cousin and my worst rank was 1.1k, but now my highest rank is diamond 3025 after 2 years. So as you see what's problem there ? I'm tank main and i mostly play dva. My dva gameplay is sometimes much better than some gm players. The proof is when i played with my teammates in Open Divsion seasson 2 2019 Europe we won against masters, diamonds and one plat probably, while my team had very low skill ratings like golds and plats. When i got replaced my team started winning, and many times carried my team to victory. But the problem is about comeptitive play especially for tank mains. I know that the better team wins always, but sometimes it's not okay. When i join to competitive play for the first what I can see is that 2 or 3 people take dps, people are toxic, and they don't even try to put playing on teamwork. Game is making boring couse of that players, also when i played in low gold matchmaking they were just much more involvement, they would like to win so if they saw 2 dps, they didn't pick another dps but a healer or tank. But on plat is like when players see 2 dps they take another one and game is losed, so why i should lose -25 or more sr for players whitch didn't want even to try play best and win the game, when i did my job best and tried to win. Otherwise, when i'll win i got +19, max 23 sr even if i carried my team. Also to rank up from 2500 to 3000 it's 500 sr. for one match when i got 20-22 sr it means, that i need to win 23-25 matches IN A ROW. Whitch is impossible to do for a tank main. I know maybe my aim is not like a top 500 players, and i'm not a dps main. It can not be like this that Top 500 players whitch main dps have only chance to get better rank, especially on smurfing whitch after first placements people are getting 50 and more sr. Where is justice ? Why new players are getting much more then one player whitch played more and has much bigger experience, must get much more less than a new players?!?!? It is started getting annoying for me and i finally decided to leave overwatch and back to cs:go. I can sit down in one rank throught one year but in CS:GO when u win maybe 6-10 matches system can see that u play better and you deserve for a better rank but in Overwatch u can deserve for better rank but it's a team play game and in blizzard system it doesn't matter that u're the best in the team but u lose couse of other teammates. CS:GO it's also team play game so what is going ? Why Blizzard can't give much more sr for win like 48-50 sr for win until u get master. I'm done with it. What do i only ask for ? BLIZZARD PLS MAKE COMPETITIVE PLAY MORE FAIRER AND GIVE MORE SR FOR WINS, THEN MANY OW PLAYERS WILL BACK WHITCH LOVE E-SPORT GAMES AND THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A FAIR PLAY, AND FAIR GRADES IN GAME!",Why does Overwatch has much more less players ?

The game was off to a good start, then I press tab and I see that we have a teammate named ""savethebeez"". So I ask in the voice chat what's with the username, and she says that bees are critically endangered, and she must show her support. I keep talking to this girl, because she is kinda funny. Then she asks me if I have discord, and if I want to join her server. I say sure, and I wind up in a server consisting of only her and her friend. After continuing to talk to her, I find out that she lives a few hours away, and that we are both the same age (17). We really hit it off, and we exchanged social medias. That was almost over 2 weeks ago, and in the meantime we have been talking to each other almost every day. We have introduced both of our groups of friends to each other, and now we know a decent amount about everyone. Me and Hannah have been spending a lot of time talking to one another, sometimes even until 3 in the morning. Video chats, discord, insta, snap, the whole shebang. The other night I told her that I think she is really cute and the highlight of my day, and now we are talking about meeting up irl. Even if nothing comes of it, we still made a bunch of new friends and are having a blast together. Just thought that this story might be appreciated by ya'll, so thanks for sticking with me :)",Wholesome OW story.
1768,Overwatch,"Hello Overwatch community!

Like  some other people I've been trying to get every single achievement in  the game, because I like the challenge of the pve ones and the playstyle  that some of them need. But I have a huge problem. Sometimes I don't  know, if I am doing okay or if my actions just set back my progress to  0. The later is espacially annoying, because I don't have any indicator  for it. Some examples:

**Waste Not, Want Not:**  get 3 solokills as Reaper. What is a Solokill? Do I have to do 100% of  the dmg? Do I have to be the only person in the killfeed (aka no boost  from a teammember alike mercy)?

**Hack The Planet:**  Hack 15 people as Sombra without dying. I have no indicator how many  people I have hacked so far. All I can do is remember the amount I have  hacked yet. But after using her ult you can only guess.

**Halt State:**  Pull enemies into 1000 damage with a single use of Orisa's Halt in  quick or competitive play. How much time can pass after the use of Halt?  Not knowing this makes timing the ability extremly difficult.

The list can go on and on, but I think you get the idea. I don't want to be only complaining, so thought about the problem and I think I have a solution:  A little textbox in top right corner, that tracks your progress. For  example, if I play as Baptise, I will see a number of the healing done +  dmg dealt of my ult. This way I can see, how close I am to 2500. Also I  can experiment with the game and figure out myself, what a solokill  exactly is. It should only display any achievement, that you can  actively get right now. So achievements that you alredy got and  achievement from other heros and maps won't get shown. Hell make it an  option, that is turned off by default, so that people, that don't care  about achievements, wont get annoyed by the textbox.

It  should be rather easy to implement this, because the game already has  these numbers somewhere and displaying them shouldn't take much time to implement. So what do you think? Is this an optimal solution or do you know a better one? :)  


Going through the achievement list, I think these achievements would benefit greatly from such a status:  
**Survival Expert,**  **Shot Down,** **I Am Your Shield,** **Mine Sweeper,** **Anger Management,** **Adaption,** **Triple Threat,** **Simple Geometry,**  **Ice Blocked,** **Huge Success,**  **Armor Up!,** **Did That Sting?,** **The Floor is Lava,** **Supersonic,**  **Group Health Plan,**  **Antipode,**  **Rapid Discord,**  **The Iris Embraces You,** **Escort Duty.** So quite a lot actually.",Would you like an ingame status on achievements?

I have ideas on the best way to execute it, but no idea how to start on Workshop. My initial thought was to use Widows and her grapple since those two are already half of the gamemode. One shit kill on widows rifle, change the unzoomed version to the rifle rather than machine gun. Make grapple have no cooldown and instantly hook on click, no delay to reach the wall. Thats the basics for the Insta Railgun with Grapple idea. 

For the freezetag mode, you just use Mei's freeze to be the result after a kill. You're frozen until everyone on your team is killed/frozen or someome unfreezes you by standing in proximity to your frozen body for 2-3 seconds. Once all players are frozen the other team wins a point. Play first to 7 points or whatever, thats not as important.

For a long time I had no decent ideas for what to do with Orisa and Brigitte, because they didn't fit into the mode due to how their kits work. But with the workshop out, I thought I might give them another shot. So I turned Orisa into this boss who's on fire, pulls enemies into her fire with left and right click, and her ultimate's kind of like a hide and seek mini game where she's put to sleep for 5 seconds and moves everyone in a certain range into the 'shadow realm' with her. After 5 seconds she seeks the not-monsters and can melee them to send them to 'oblivion' (off the map) to their deaths. However ever since I put her in the mode, she's randomly pressing buttons. Like her left click will just start firing, she'll randomly use her right click and ult. Sometimes her ult will immediately give her another ult. And I don't get why. If anyone could test the mode and tell me, that'd be great. ♥

1967,Overwatch,"This is something I've always wondered and never been able to ascertain a clear answer. This is tagged as console because I am a console player currently, and I'm looking for advice from people who have played console and PC or at least used M/KB with console games that support it.

I want to maybe get this game for PC to try out M/KB controls, but I've never gamed on PC in my life. One of the reasons I want to do this is because I feel like gaming is eventually heading to the M/KB format as more games even on consoles (I currently play on PS4) start supporting it and PC gaming becomes more popular. I don't think M/KB is going anywhere as the dominant control system as far as skill ceiling goes.

&amp;#x200B;

I always see people rant and rave about how much better M/KB users are, especially when it comes to heroes like Widow/Hanzo/Ashe/McCree, even though most heroes in this game can't even ADS.

Understanding that a console player will likely be trash using M/KB for a little while until they get used to a new control setup, putting that aside....

&amp;#x200B;

Will learning to use a M/KB really improve the average player's performance that much though? Or does it simply raise the skill ceiling and allow good players to reach higher levels of performance than would be possible with a controller? I see reports from people who buy a M/KB or switch to PC and feel like they actually get worse and go back to controller. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just want to know if it would be worth investing my time in to learn as someone who has played FPS games with a controller his whole life.","Will a M/KB really make the average player that much better at this game, or does it simply increase the skill ceiling for good players?"
