1,leagueoflegends,"Hello Guys,  
I made the mistake of typing in chat today and was punished by my top laner for it.

[https://youtu.be/pUFsIPvwGPY](https://youtu.be/pUFsIPvwGPY)

The story of this is as follows: Top lane poppy got camped by enemy jungler, our jungler camped bot lane. Poppy said jungle should gank her lane. I said ""Jg is helping us out very much in bot lane, you are a tank so you should be ok, right?""

Poppy took offense to that and left top lane and decided to grief me for the rest of the game.

I apologize for saying anything and was simply trying to reassure poppy that the jungler was helping us out on botside so he wasn't just afk in his jungle doing nothing.

I made the mistake of telling poppy that she was a tank so she should be ok top and was punished for it.

I have tried contacting Riot support about it but you cannot provide any evidence of foul play on their website. The support ticket simply returns a webpage that says ""We see you reported this player in game, thank you for your report!""

That means that Riot won't ever view this footage right? That as long as poppy didn't type any restricted words in chat that she will not be punished for this right?

What can I do in this situation?  


Thanks",Is this reportable?

30,leagueoflegends,"With the MSI cancellation caused by the global pandemic, the Spring 2020 split for the LCS has been relegated to a scrim split. The Champions C9 will surely have a huge leg up in practice versus their LCS competition given the level they are at, but the advantage they should have gained from going to MSI and competing at the highest level has now evaporated. The incredible 26-2 record now means nothing for the ultimate goal, the quest for the summoners cup.  

The old qualification system with points being awarded for spring and summer split with a focus on summer split did make spring split matter to a certain extent, but the playoff results were what mattered. All that really mattered was a team made that top 6 and then had good best of 5 results. The 18 games in the regular season of the spring split were then completely forgotten.  

When the decision to move to one playoff format to determine all 3 seeds was announced I was excited, but the decision to have Spring Split results not count towards seeding in worlds qualification was dumbfounding. Every regular season game should have some reflecting on seeding for the worlds qualification tournament (which in this case is only summer playoffs). If the LCS just took from Overwatch and did a split playoffs halfway through the season (after 18 games, the second round robin) to qualify for MSI, but still count the regular season record towards the summer playoffs for worlds qualification, every game throughout the season would matter. Every team will try to prepare smarter for the spring split and come out stronger. As it is now we find teams coming together finally in week 6 or later because they didn't practice as a team until a week or two before spring split started.  

Summer playoffs with its expansion to 8 teams, could see great battles between teams that struggled in spring finally get the pieces together to make a push for playoffs to make a run through the bracket. Teams who get a bunch of wins in spring should have an advantage over teams with 5 or 6 should be put at a disadvantage. While the point qualification satisfied this somewhat, that was based more on playoffs results and made the regular season games have less meaning.  

If the LCS truly want viewers to tune in to all the weekly games, a one season, 36 game format would go a long way. If we keep MSI, a mid season (after the second round robin, 18 games with current format) qualifier to determine the LCS seed would keep spring playoffs on the table, while not throwing away those 18 regular season games.",LCS needs to move to single season.

Nope. C9 take every award...

Continuing my series, I give you the Matchup Rankings for the LCS for the entire 2020 regular season. These are the rankings looking at how players performed in champion specific matchups across the year normalized across all of professional Lol. I posted one of these at the half way point that got positive responses so I thought I should do the 2020 season and MVP. More background below.

[MVP](https://i.imgur.com/dlbxy5w.png)**:** First, I would like to point out this just includes regular season stats. I took a different approach to my MVP, essentially what I did is look at the player's win rate, his team score average, and his team's second highest performing player. I then used this too determine who was carrying their team to the highest win rate. I think it is fun to have data different than what the analysts say, but this time I think Blaber is just so convincingly the MVP. Congrats to Blaber!

*Processing img de2gf8o4olu41...*

**Background:** We see a lot of rankings based on differentials, but those have always bothered me a lot of the time. Players are playing losing champion matchups and then being attacked later (after people forget the matchups) for having a low CS differential or gold differential for the year. So I wanted to make a matchup-proof ranking.

To further elaborate, what this ranking is doing is looking at how, for example, a pro played Leblanc into Zoe and comparing against how every other mid or top laner pro player played that matchup. So if you score really high, that could mean every game this season you were down in CS, but what it would also mean, is that when other pros played that EXACT same matchup, they were even more down in CS. So, if Faker was down 15 cs in a matchup, that probably means on average, other pros were down somewhere between 20-30 cs in that same matchup, as an example, as Faker has a good score.

So what is v3. v1 and v2 did a good job of accounting for laning statistics, those are obviously still included. But I have now focused on adding three more statistics/things: roaming/towers and game effectiveness. (1) Roaming/Towers looks at how often you were involved with first bloods outside of your lane and also your gold income outside of CS. If you roam and get a kill, what did it cost? I think people tend to forget about turret plates in pro play. And (2) game effectiveness, this looks at how much damage you are doing over the amount of gold you are getting as well as your ability to translate that into wins. (Please keep in mind these stats are also normalized against champion matchups) And (3) JUNGLERS AND BOT LANES NOW INCLUDED.

[Infographic on the MVP](https://twitter.com/Data_Richy/status/1253370292916957191)

P.S. AS ALWAYS, additional shoutout to [https://oracleselixir.com/](https://oracleselixir.com/) for the data, Tim Sevenhuysen is doing great work out there.

P.P.S. The data is normalized so that you can compare across categories, a 99 doesn't mean 99 CS diff, it means 99th percentile (you are the best) for that statistic.

I had to fight through 4 promo matches, but the highlight was definitely in those final moments of game 4.  It was a BLOODY game of nonstop aggression and we were down 7k gold, but I wanted this win so badly. We met the enemy team at elder, but they had control of the pit. Our top lane aatrox dives in 1v5, but while the enemy team turns to evaporate the poor darkin, I ulted over the wall into 3 of them, won the smite fight, and got off enough damage to kill 3 of them at the cost of my life. I may have died during the chaos, but got to watch satisfied as my team picked up another kill and managed to push down mid for a comeback victory.

72,leagueoflegends,"# Preseason s5

Season 5 brings changes to the pro scene. Sister teams will no longer be , and as such, 10-player rosters emerge. SKT, who came from a disappointing S4 after failing to qualify for Worlds and losing its hegemony against Samsung, takes advantage of the situation and makes changes to the lineup.  H0R0, Piglet and PoohManDu leave, shortly after Impact leaves to Team Impulse in NA.  The rest of the SKT K and S players remain and the only signing is Piccaboo, an aggressive support recognized for his roaming style. In this way, the SKT roster would be: MaRin in top, Bengi in jg, Faker and Easyhoon in mid, Bang in bot and Wolf plus Piccaboo as supps.

But the new system would not be the only thing that the preseason would bring. The Korean Exodus saw an immense number of Korean players leave the region, mostly seduced by China's high wages. Samsung, current Worlds champion with the two best teams of Season 4 (Blue and Ozone/White), saw ALL of their players leave the organization. The throne in Korea was free, and with it a league that had to be reorganized after everything that had happened.

Finally, it should be noted that the Champions Spring Preseason, a mini tournament with the idea of ​​helping teams adapt to changes, was played in Korea. SKT finished first with a [4-1-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUDEXJConDk), the draw against KT Rolster. Impact was still on the team at the time, but MaRin had already taken the top lane with an excellent tournament. The rest of the players did rotate more, although Wolf also seemed to play better with Bang than Piccaboo. So, in the midst of the chaos SKT came as a favorite at the spring split.

# Spring 2015

As expected, at the beginning most teams had a hard time adapting to their new rosters, except one.  GE Tigers was founded that preseason with a roster made up of former NaJin and Incredible Miracle players. Smeb, Lee, KurO, PraY and GorillA, all already experienced but little individual success except for the bot lane. PraY had been an OGN champion and one of the best adc's in the region, but he was already a split away from the scene and his current level was unknown. Meanwhile, GorillA was the one who brought the best feelings after a great Worlds with NaJin White Shield.

To everyone's surprise, that Tigers team swept with a perfect first half of the split. Smeb, previously considered by many to be the worst top laner in Korea, was now probably the best with Duke of NaJin. Lee was dominating the jg, just like PraY / GorillA in bot lane. Finally, KurO was the wild card. He did what the team needed from him and, beyond the laning phase, he was a very reliable and consistent player.

The rest of the top4 was made up of CJ Entus, Jin Air Green Wings and SKT, who had a tough start with a 4-3 that left bittersweet feelings for the fans. As if that were not enough, Piccaboo was having health problems, so Wolf started in the vast majority of games. However, the SK Telecom T1 of the second half was [unstoppable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkQice3jhA). They didn't lose a single series to finish the regular season second, to a single Tigers victory. MaRin had successfully mated the team with tanks and his stellar Rumble. Faker and Easyhoon were probably the two best mids in the league and Bang was an adc capable of carrying when necessary. Bengi benefited greatly from Cinderhulk's new meta which allowed him to play less aggressive jg's, and Wolf, despite leaving most doubts, worked pretty well with Bang. Finally, a rookie appears and takes Bengi's position in the final stretch. His ID is T0M and he has a very aggressive style, something very different compared to the usual Bengi.  Despite the meta that prioritized utility junglers, he plays 4 of the last 3 series and appears to be the team's starting jg for playoffs.

# Spring playoffs

As second place, SKT awaited in SF for the winner between CJ Entus and Jin Air. The sad plane had a very positive start, but couldn't adapt to the meta and little by little they were leaving weaknesses until they lost feelings. Even so, the team was very talented, especially in GBM that was having the split of his career. On the other hand, CJ Entus had the opposite effect with the new meta, which allowed Shy and Coco to expand their champ pool, while Ambition was more comfortable in his new jungle role by being able to play more of a utility and control style. Also, Space and MadLife were back and probably had their best season together.

In the end, what was expected happened and CJ Entus took the victory against Jin Air, although the 3-0 was surprising. CJE wiped out JAG without problems and earned its place against SKT in Round 2. The series was expected to be taken away by SKT, but CJE's initial 2-0 changed the minds of many. Shy completely controlled the first two games and put Korea's best in shape team on the ropes. T0M played at the beginning of the series, but after falling in Game 2 SKT did not hesitate to put Bengi back. The veteran jungler had an immediate impact, taking the MVP of Game 3 and controlling Ambition much better.  The next game would be one of the most exciting in the whole year, with CJ Entus about to close the series if it were not for the [wonderful tp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yfsg03RN6T4) of MaRin to stop the minion wave. Bang took care of the rest and brought the series to Game 5 where Faker's LeBlanc did what it is used to. [3-2 SKT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ngApaaUzAE) and a series to remember.

GE Tigers awaited in the final, although not the same as in the first half. After surprisingly falling against Team WE at the IEM World Championship, the Tigers fell twice in the regular split, including a 0-2 loss to SKT that changed the image of the favorite. What was also surprising was the final, and that is that [SKT's 3-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHq0FszX_8&amp;list=PLJwuLHutaYuJrHS1GnMVfI5NuunZ2HDkm) showed overwhelming superiority, even more if you consider that Bengi and Faker did not play for a minute that day. Instead, T0M and [Easyhoon returned in the best way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ch20MjX0w) to win the MVP in all 3 games. The throne that Samsung had left was once again SKT's, but that's never enough. That year a new tournament was to be released in the middle of the year that would bring together the best teams from each region. The MSI was the next objective, with the title of best team in the world at stake.

# MSI

When the Spring split was just starting around the world, GE Tigers and Edward Gaming positioned themselves as the best. However, the IEM World Championship marked a before and after for the Koreans, who saw their region fail on the international scene. GE Tigers was no longer in the discussion for best team in the world, but EDG wasn't going to be alone either. It was at that time that the new meta arrived and SKT began its rise to become an unstoppable force. So, under this challenge of looking for the best team and the best region in the world, MSI 2015 arrived to answer those questions.

The tournament was short, 4 full days of League of Legends with which SKT, recently champion of KR, had little time to prepare. Even so, the group stage was a clear 5-0 that left them first place and favorites, although not invincible. It is true that the first day they had no problems beating Besiktas, TSM and EDG, but the Chinese draft was more than questionable, which added to the closeness of the games against Fnatic and ahq on day 2, left an image of less dominance.

Thus the semifinals were reached against the Fnatic of the rookies. After the disappointing 2014, the European squad had to restructure from the veteran YellOwStaR, who also had a year to remember.  The support played aggressive, started plays and was the leader of a team that ended up surprising everyone. Huni came as a complete stranger, and left MSI as one of the best top laner in the world without a doubt. Febiven also controlled his lane as the best, even considering that he supplied the xPeke legend. Reignover was the perfect companion for Huni and Steeelback, probably the weakest point, he showed himself as a consistent and competitive adc. Fnatic loved to fight, make the game so aggressive and uncontrolled that they could get ahead with their teamfights. A very nice style, but not for SKT that day.

The Huni, Reignover and Febiven top side had an impressive day, controlling several early games throughout the Bo5. What better example of what the [two solokills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5nCMf_lSdE) from Febiven to Faker in Game 3.  The series was exciting, with a map for each team up to the limit point. [Game 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbNBDntqHlY), Fnatic to a map of doing what has never been done and even more so, with a team of rookies!

But that was not the day to make history. Bengi, who played the entire tournament as a starter since SKT preferred to take Easyhoon over T0M, picked Nunu in the last game and controlled the game from start to finish. Again history repeated itself, SKT in the final and Bengi being key for his team in the important moments.

In the end, the two favorites met expectations and would face each other in a historic final.  EDG beat ahq with an easy 3-0 that reinforced their image for the final, especially after the bad game against SKT in the group stage. Deft was the best adc in the world and the main carry of the team, in conversation as the best player in the world. The other import, PawN, was still in great shape as a world champion and was in charge of taking pressure off Deft. Meanwhile, Koro1, Clearlove and Meiko were in charge of dominating the map. The first as a safe and consistent top, the second as the best CN jg and possibly in the world, and the last a rookie that surprised everyone with his initiations and mechanics. Together they moved throughout the Rift to dive, set up vision and make objectives, although their early game was their weak point, recovering many games from their excellent teamfighting ability.

The final had everything, emotions, great plays and some of the best players in the world in a great moment. After all, these two teams were clearly the best. The series [started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mkE4dnFZag&amp;t=1s) with a great game from Easyhoon and Bang that gave SKT the advantage. However, EDG changed the plan and comfortably took [the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFd-30he8xs) [two games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffnUTA_UdFE). SKT was back on the ropes again and Faker returned to [Game 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGGCHmR-TbM&amp;t=292s) to become a figure and force the deciding game.

What happened next was one of the best drafts in the entire history of competitive LoL. Aaron, EDG's coach, left Nunu and LeBlanc open for Bengi and Nunu.  Jungler and mid laner couldn't resist and picked two of their best champs. Everything was going according to plan. EDG then went on to form a composition full of champs capable of ignoring the LeBlanc burst, where Morgana stood out for PawN and Evelynn for Clearlove. [37 minutes later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOhPQasWVNE), EDG was the MSI 2015 champion with Clearlove as MVP. Korea and SKT were not invincible, the exodus had worked.

85,leagueoflegends,"This is just a discussion thread, keep that in mind.

Yuumi was one of my favorite characters ever released, although strong, riot made some changes that I really disliked, yuumi got more unfun to play with but still differently strong.

With her changes, riot transformed all yuumi's damage into healing, and the ""cc counter"" to her is just terrible, because it doesn't solve anything of her problems since when she receives a CC she is basically dead but against no CC team she is super strong.

First of all, one of the things I hate the most about her abilities is her passive, it's just useless since most of the time you'll only use it early game and it's not worth to use it with a risk to receive a CC and die. 

I have some suggestions about her and I would like to hear your opinion.

**PASSIVE** COOLDOWN: 20-8 -&gt; 16-4

**Shield suration**: until broken -&gt; 4 seconds.

**New:** Now also deals 10-60 (based on level) (+40%ap) bonus damage.

-----------------------------------------------------------
**Q** Cooldown: 13.5-7.5 -&gt; 15-11s

**Q Damage** - **Reworked**: Deals from 50/.../200 (+40% ap) up to 80/300 (+40%ap )damage based on the travelled distance.

     ^---&gt; Not attached to an ally: Max damage at max range. Attached to ally: Max range at the edge of the duration (3 seconds).

**Q** attached duration: 2 -&gt; Back to 3 seconds (the duration was never the problem, but the range of the skill)

**Q** Slow: 20 -&gt; 15%

**Q Range** reduced by around 15%

**New**: Empowered attacks from passive reduce Q cooldown by 3 seconds and increases the slow of the next Q to 50%.

---------------------------------------------------------
**W Changes:**

**CC** no longer puts W in a 5 second cooldown.

**New**: Detaching from an ally will put the ability in a 2 second cooldown (Detaching from an ally to no ally). 
Receiving crowd control resets the cooldown (The 2 second cooldown as mentioned before).

**Detaching** from an ally range: 250 -&gt; 350
---------------------------------------------------------

**E Changes:**

**Heal**: 70-190 -&gt; 60-140 (+40 -&gt; +35% ability power)

**New:** Empowered attacks from passive increase next E heal by 50%.

---------------------------------------------------------
**R additional funcionality:** While attached, she can slowly moove the direction of final chapter (similtar to velkoz ultimate)
-
---------------------------------------------------------

These suggestions are especially to make yuumi make greater use of her passive and at the same time have more counterplay against her since she will be more vulnerable but more rewardable at the same time.",Yuumi suggestions and discussion

98,leagueoflegends,"So as we all know the game is usually decided by which teams autofilled player plays better however this seems like an entirely randomly generated factor. The only non random factor is the average MMR of the players in the game which VERY EVIDENTLY doesn't account for autofill even if it claims to.

Autofill should not even exist within the ranked game mode as it skews the matchmaking so much, pretty much regardless of the role that it occurs in. In no other competitive event do you play a different role to the main role you play.

 In football a striker will never play in defense, or a goalkeeper up front. In Rugby a scrum half will never play front row. So why on Earth is it excusable to put an ADC/Support main in top. This should simply be outlawed in a competitive environment. One of the ways you can solve it or alleviate this issue is to possible add a tertiary role which can remove the 4th or 5th role autofills. 

Also a serverwide role counter should be shown in lobby/queue to show what roles are being queued for in what percentage or raw number. This will mean players have the ability to choose live between lower queue times and preferred role.

103,leagueoflegends,"To be honest, rift rivals and the MSI feels so unimportant compared to the Worlds. So i thought about how to make these competitions much more important and fun to watch

The whole point of the rift rivals is to determine the strongest league. However, the winning region has no advantages and it seems that the result doesn't matter. What if we give the 4th seed to the winner of the rift rivals? That way, the regions would compete more to get more possibility to be in the worlds.

For the MSI, why don't we give the winning team a free seed for the worlds? If a team has won the msi, it means that they are the strongest team in the world in the spring season. I think that proves that the team skilled enough to take a shot at the worlds. 

Long story short, the international competitions feel like they are not important so we should make the prize much more valuable by giving the team/region advantages at worlds.

111,leagueoflegends,,Most tilting thing [Gamebug]
112,leagueoflegends,,Nidalee and Thresh Outplay
113,leagueoflegends,"The problem with Yi is the tank on hit itemization. When he was reworked in S3 on hit was far weaker than it is now. Back then Yi was vulnerable because the tank items weren't as good and onhit did less damage. Most Yi players were playing crit back then which is a lot harder to play due to the high cost and the ability for the enemy team to land a CC and blow Yi up. Yi should have always been balanced around this play style and not onhit. He is a skirmisher like Tryndamere but Yi was allowed to become a tank while also being able to shred anyone and you cannot itemize against Yi anymore due to rageblade and whits end. 

The other problem with Yi is that as a jungler his weakness is removed and that is that most players need to solo farm on him due to his early game being very matchup based. At early game Yi needs to play extremely cautiously and know when to engage. One wrong move and you cost yourself a fight vs the majority of champions. Jungle Yi is just too safe for this champion. Everyone hate's the aspect of Yi being an afk jungler because of a) he doesn't help the team, b) he comes in later fed and takes all the kills.

I think the solution to the funneling and Yi being too easy is to make him into a laner. Yi can be played top, mid, and ADC effectively but only with more advanced mechanics. 

A few years ago Faker played Yi mid and everyone loved it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmOdOM-R12s

Here is another video of what mid Yi mechanics and gameplay can be:



If you watch it is pretty mechanically intensive because Yi is vulnerable in any lane due to having no escape to ganks. Also many of the matchups early game are not in Yis favor. By being a laner it gives more opportunity to shut down Yi early and also forces the Yi player to think more about what they are doing rather than just afk farming for 20 minutes. 

In the past two years Riot has gone in the wrong direction with Yi and has actually nerfed laning and buffed jungling on a few occasions. The change to Q minion damage is in response to funneling. They made it so that Q no longer gives bonus damage to minions to try to curb Yi's gold and pushing power with a funneler support. Another nerf is the E bonus damage which was completely removed making CSing harder. 

I think the ideal solution is to take Yi out of the jungle by having some changes like this:


Q - Remove monster damage, add minion damage back. This means Yi can't clear jungle champs quickly and making jungling not viable. 


E - Add bonus damage back, true damage only applies to minions and champs. Another nerf to jungle damage. 


Passive - Doublestrike is 100% damage vs minions on second auto. The second auto being 50% damage has always been a problem when csing because it is hard to control and clumsy and causes a lot of missed CS.


R - I think this spell needs crit interaction. Something like Yi gains 20% attack speed and an additional 15% if he critically strikes forcing Yi to go crit as part of the build. 


Also rageblade should be removed, it's 75% of Yi's power now and it's stupid that a champion relies on one items so heavily.  It's too good on pretty much everyone who uses it.","Master Yi needs to be converted to a laner, my thoughts as a Yi main and how to fix funneling."

There is effectively no counterplay to a Rek'sai gank. Her flash knockup combo is certain death which means you have to immediately burn flash if she shows up in your lane, and even without her flash, she guarantees that she'll land her full combo just by hitting you with a Chilling Smite even if you're playing safe and far back.

What does everyone think of Rek'sai's ult being avoidable again? It's clear that it's not healthy for the game. Ever since she had it changed, she's been back to being a constant S tier pick (A at the very -minimum- even when not favored in a meta) because of her overbearing early jungle pressure.",You should be able to dodge Rek'sai's ult if her smite is going to apply it.

147,leagueoflegends,"Moin,

League of Legends gibt es schon seit mittlerweile mehr als 10 Jahren und eines hat mich schon immer gestört: Teammates die Schreiben/Tilten/Ausrasten/Afk gehen.

Von daher finde ich, dass die League of Legends Server nicht nur in die einzelnen Regionen eingeteilt werden sollten, sondern dazu auch in verschiedenen Mentalitäten. Bevorzuge ich es mit einem sehr guten Spieler zu spielen, der eventuell leicht zu tilten ist oder spiele ich lieber mit einem etwas schlechteren Spieler, der sich nicht aus der Ruhe bringen lässt? Ich persönlich bevorzuge zweites, aber was soll das ganze nun bewirken?   


Ich selber habe viele Spieler erlebt, die sich in Grund und Boden tilten lassen, mehr schreiben als spielen und ""open mid"" oder ""ff 15"" nach 5 Minuten im Spiel schreiben. Natürlich gibt es Spiele, die deutlich verloren sind, jedoch gibt es auch sehr viele Spiele, die durch das Aufgeben, Tilten und Schreiben beeinflusst und dadurch verloren werden. Wenn ich mir also selber aussuchen könnte, mit welchen ""Mentalitäts""-Typen ich spiele, dann kann ich mich auch genau darauf einstellen. Wenn ich von vorne rein weiß, dass alle ""nett"" sind und das Spiel gewinnen wollen, ohne dabei wie wilde Hunde zu schreiben, dann kann ich auch mal eine Lane verlieren ohne zu denken ""oh nein jetzt rastet der gleich aus"". 

  
Dazu ein Beispiel: Ich habe auf Varus mal ein Q auf einen Gegner  im  early game verfehlt und schon hat einer meiner Teammates den Fragezeichenping gespamt und ""youre actual trash"" geschrieben. Fehler passieren jedem Mal, warum darf ich nicht einmal verfehlen?  


Wenn man solch eine Unterteilung machen würde, dann könnte man das Report System daran auch anknüpfen. Spieler, die sich in der ""netten"" Region befinden und trotzdem Beleidigen, sollten daher stärker bestraft werden als zuvor. Genau umgekehrt gilt es auch für die toxischen Spieler, die wohl ""gute Spieler"" sind. Wenn man extra schlecht spielt, sodass das System es nicht direkt als ""intentional feeding"" anerkennt, sollten genauer beobachtet werden und daher stärker bestraft werden.   


Dazu ein Beispiel: Ein Spieler (Jarvan) aus meinem Team hat nach 10 Minuten alle seine Items verkauft. Da er aber noch mal ab und zu ein Jungle Camp gemacht hat oder uns mit seiner Standarte eine Verstärkung geben hat, wurde er nicht als ""AFK"" oder ""intentional feed"" betrachet.

Ich freue mich auf eure Reaktionen

8. The remaining teams are drawn into top 8 seeding as per the usual worlds format herein, except teams from the same group can now draw each other.

This should mean:

* more wildcards have a chance to play stage games against non-wildcard teams
* the play-ins can be shortened leaving more time for the big teams to face off
* the use of BO3s earlier in the tournament would prevent too many additional games occurring
* the top 8 are the best 8 in the tournament; double elimination becoming less important as the tournament goes on

China might be able to shake off the claim of only winning with Korean imports, or just strengthen the claim.

217,leagueoflegends,"Edit: Made some final adjustments to make absolutely sure my post is following the League of Legends subreddit rules.

I know what you're going to say: ""Hey there! Firstly, I'd like to thank you for bringing this issue to our hands - Helping us track the players that need to be reformed is super nice of you, thanks for being an active member of the community"" , sounds about right? It's the default response you get from mailing Riot to report a player. Now I don't go about mailing lightly, I often use the report button in-game and move on the next. I'm mailing Riot when I see behaviour that imo should result in a IP ban from the community, often very racist things, wishing people would kill themselves, or one of the newer ones: ""Hope your entire family dies of corona"".

Let me be very clear, I'm not here to discuss particular cases, but I hope that we as a community could finally have our voices heard and start acting against negative behaviour in our community. When it comes to player privacy we often get the reply from Riot: ""I'm sure you already know about the privacy policy thingy which means that we can't share info about what will happen to other players"". Respecting player privacy is something I really do value and I'm appreciating Riot taking it this seriously, but it feels like Riot is taking ""player privacy"" as an excuse not to protect its community from very toxic behaviour, and it should stop now.

As an ""active member of the community"" I'm not here to rant, I have my own ideas on how to address and solve the issue and I will go into more detail in a bit. But first I want to briefly go over ""smurfs"" as I saw it was brought up a few days ago here on this subreddit. Riot doesn't allow smurf account, completely understandable as it ruins other peoples games. However, being in a smurf game is not a free pass for negative behaviour. Going afk minute 5 should not have a place in this game, wishing people too die should not have a place in this game and racism should not have a place in this game. What troubles me, and the reason why I'm reaching out on these forums is how easy it should be to track down these type of behaviours, without it taking any time of Riot staff.

Smurfs: sharing twitch stream links in lobby should easily be a red flag on a player account, mentioning the word ""smurf"" over and over again should too, leveling an account and going 30/0 on your first game, buying an account and having different behaviour, having multiple accounts on the same IP, all red flags. Now I do understand a single one of these behaviours should not justify an account being banned, but combine several of these and you have a very strong case. I can actually name quite a few top streamers that advertise their smurf accounts over and over and over again, without any actions being taken. Again, not here to talk about particular cases, but I feel Riot is neglecting its responsibility to provide a fair/fun player environment.

Racism: most of the words/sentences used for racism should be so easy to track down with just a few lines of code, red flagging an account for a staff member to look at should result in only banning those who deserve it, why isn't this happening more often?

AFK/Giving up: ""open mid"", ""ff 15"", ""a summoner has disconnected"" I'm sure we all see it at least 20% of the games we're in, often between minute 5 and 10. It absolutely amazes me how often I see this in game. Over the last few months I've seen people reply: ""Enjoy your ban"", getting into a conversation with someone running down lanes with 6 blue sapphire items. ""Riot doesn't ban for this, this is the 30th game I do this"". I couldn't believe it, buying 6 blue sapphire's minute 10 should be so easy for Riot to track and red flag that I couldn't believe it not getting banned. I started writing peoples names down that showed this type of behaviour, looking up their game history after several weeks and noticed they just continued to play, often having the same stats over and over again.

I really hope we can stand up as a community and let Riot know that it's us people that have to sit through these games, allowing 1 of those jerks to continue to play will cause frustration by 50, 100 maybe even 250 of us decent players in the community. If Riot want to respect peoples privacy, be my guest, you don't have to show peoples personal details, just remove these guys from your community.

Now on to the next part, the struggle that Riot might have: Banning people seems great at first but may result in people start/buy a new account. Getting being placed in divisions they don't belong, again ruining other player's their game. If we'd make some minor tweaks to the already in place honor system, with matchmaking taking honor levels into account: You often get honored? You get matched with equally honored players. Getting reported often, Riot investigates and penalising your account, dropping honor level and again getting matched with equally honored player. We can have this system get into negative honor, getting matched with player who also abandon games, give up minute 5, or flame each other, not being reported for several games could get you back to neutral, slowly grinding your way back up to higher honor levels and better gameplay experience. If people try to avoid the honor system by making new accounts, an IP ban should take care of them, forever removing them from your/our community.

I realise that my ideas are probably far from perfect, but I think it's a step into the right direction. I'm absolutely confident that with the help of the community, we can think of a system that provides a healthy player environment for the entire community.

**TLDR: Players can continue to ruin games for other players and it looks like not much is being done (or far from enough). Violations can be easily tracked, why don't we?**

Edit: an earlier reply brought to my attention that Riot earlier stated to be against ""Prisoner's Island"", matchmaking toxic people with toxic people. However, ""longer queues"" are a non-argument, higher elo queues are also higher, it makes people think twice before surrendering a game minute 4 in-game.  Also, there are plenty of ways to make absolutely sure that toxic players can make their way out of ""prisoners island"", it doesn't have to be a permanent thing.",Ways to address the toxic community

I've told Riot to check the replay because he was trolling and I've tried explaining that he tilted the whole team but they just don't care.

2. Ironwall tanks that somehow have tons of damage. Again, high base skill damages mean they get to deal a ton of damage without any god damn items. Sejuanni's E, if you hit both parts has a 40+190+2% HP + 5.25% HP base damage. Thats 393 damage, with no items. Sion and Naut also hurt, a lot.

3. Supports, that bully lanes around. We all know Lux hurts. But did you know Bard's Q has the same damage and actually tensy higher scaling than Lux's? Or that Nami's Ebb and flow only deals 10 damage less? That a full charge Janna tornado is stronger than any of these? 

Oof. 

But what champions don't have good base damage? Well, we can look at Adcs, where we see Ashe's Volley has a max base damage of 80 (+ 100% AD). Xayah's skills also have low base damage. Even Jinx's and Caits long range poke skills (Zapp and Peacemaker) have pretty low max damages. The real loosers are Assasins: You have to look hard at Zed, Kat and Rengar to find base damages per skill close or over 200, with maybe one non ult skill in their kit having that base damage.

So what's all the problem?

The problem is that you cannot keep a bruiser, tank or support down. They will gain levels, and become relevant by end game. But an Adc or assassin that's shut out is totally shut down. Conversely, a bruiser, tank, or mage that gets fed has both good base damages and the ability to go into scaling or defensive items, making them both a threat and remarkably hard to deal with.

This is addition to the fact that CC is *always* relevant, and loaded on these base damage champion kits, while assassins / adcs have little to none, so cannot even fall back on it.

This is why you get that 10/2 Jax running over your team. The Aatrox who got 3 kills top, then ended the game 25/2.

This is why botlane is irrelevant, and games are won in top and jungle (outside pro leagues, obviously). If you have someone there who gets fed, they take off like a skyrocket, and other champions simply lack the tools to fight them, when a bruiser or tank with a level advantage and defensive items can easily take a close quarters fight and win it 1v1, 1v2.

It also means making picks is really strong, as if you have high base damages, you can apply strong burst to people who are picked, and even if they live, the defensive items invested in make ithard to fight back.

I'm not objectiving to tanks or bruisers or supports doing damage. But more of it should be scaling based: Maybe if they had 3 pretty offensive items, the current amount of damage would seem reasonable. A darius with say, a black cleaver, a titanic hydra and a deaths dance (whatever) is much more reasonable to have kill you compared to one with a black cleaver, a dead mans plate, and spirit visage. If a bard slapped you hard with a couple of pretty magey AP items, like a ludens, hourglass and morellos, instead of redemption, Athenes and knights vow. 

When you lower base damages, you lower the damage in fights, making picks and CC less important compared to things like, damage - mana efficency, teamfighting effectively. You make laning easier, as hitting the 1/10 skills you failed to dodge is less of an instant win for the opponents. A single kill, level, base damage increase doesn't amp their power so much. Characters have to choose between damage and utility / defense.

In short: Put the chill on the game. It's fast, lopsided, and only certain champion classes are relevant.",The problem with LoL is base skill damages.

As one could notice my version is not considered to be the exact replica of the blade we have in the original game. This is because of the limitation I've had during the creation and lack of experience in this sphere. 

 If anyone wants to try the blade out here's the link to my mod on Nexus:   
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/102433](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/102433)",I've tried to create Katarina's blade in Blender and add it to Skyrim. Here's the result

291,leagueoflegends,"Sylas ist just way too tanky for the amount of damage he deals. I'm not talking about his W healing (everyone knows it's way too much and heal reduction somehow doesn't seem to affect it). 

He starts off with 525 base HP (decent) and then gains 115 per Level! Thats the highest HP gain per level in the game (ignoring Kled/Skarl). Coupled with a high HP/5, well above average armor/level gain and the highest! MR/level gain, that just seems overtuned to me. Add an early Kindlegem/Protobelt into the mix, and he just feels unnaturally tanky. Add his melee conqueror healing and I think everyone begins to see the problem.   
At the same time being able to 100-0 carries and outduel most tanks just seems waaaay too strong.

TLDR: Sylas has a very high damage output, paired with extremely good base stats making me absolutely hate playing against him",Sylas is way too tanky

299,leagueoflegends,"So I got back into league within the last 2 months or so and played ranked. I got placed really low like iron 2 low.

I easily get tilted, which rarely happened to me before. I know it sounds cliché, but I swear I keep getting really bad teams. I feel like I'm just permanently a bronze player now. I have noticed that although I do not feed, but rather I still do the best on my team most of the time, but I also am not able to carry games anymore because I feel mentally exhausted. I keep telling myself every game that it's my bad I should've been here or there, don't this or that whatever. But, many times it just comes down to the fact that my teammates were bad. I don't know what happened, I was on a 10 game winning streak then all of a sudden, I literally lost 9 in a row. All the losses are demoralizing, especially since none of them have been because I was doing very bad, it was always because another lane fed. I've just come to the point where I don't feel like trying to carry a game because it's just exhausting and tilts me whenever I see a teammate just make decisions that are the opposite of what they should be doing.

308,leagueoflegends,,Ekko son of the sand
309,leagueoflegends,"Hey all.

Firstly I want to be clear that I am not here to bash on the game of League and that's not my intention. 

So I have just started leveling an account on EUW and just started playing 5 of my placement games. Before doing this however I did what I always do when getting into a new game and looked at some veterans on youtube explaining the basics (such as IWD, Neace, Last Shadow) and I looked at some of Tyler1's recent climb videos for jungle as I wanted to main this role.

Playing normal games I found that I was finding that in alot of games there was regularly someone leaving. This was not always on my team but alot (turned out to be around 60%) of the games were usually 9 people. I would ask for clarity on this in chat and people would say that in normal games nobody really cared that much implying that ranked was a different experience.

Well having just started ranked I have found it to be exactly the same ( 3 of 5 games with leavers). Regularly people would die to a situation, say ""ff"" in all chat or something similar and then subsequently leave the game. I played jungle so would mute all when I'd hear a line of ""no ganks, jung dif etc."" just like I'd seen in the video guides from vets mentioned above, but low and behold, with a silent chat you then suddenly hear the dreaded sound of ""A summoner has disconnected."" 

So personally as it satnds I dont really see the appeal of playing the game. Like I said it hasn't always been stacked against me and some games have been a steam role resulting from one of my players taunting the other teams player and getting them to quit. Either way though I don't really enjoy the 9 player style of the game.

So the point I'm getting at is that my experience has been completely different to the experiences of these vets playing in low elo and the video guides they show. Rarely do I see someone actually completely quit the game without returning and they even state that you will 'occassionally' get this and 'most' people play ranked to win games so keep persepective. Well it is not a subjective opinion for me, around 60% of games have been 9 players and that is definately not 'occassionally' and the majority of players have not seemd to be playing to win if they leave.

Someone said recently that a major problem is that streamers link their streams in pre game chat so then team mates become self concious that they are being judged, resulting in them trying to play at their best.

So I'm just double checking with others to get clarity on whether I'm just in an unfortunate and non typical situation?

I've played over 100 games so it seems law of averages makes it hard for it to be a luck thing but I don't understand why the game would be popular if it was regularly a 9 player moba?

Thanks in advance guys.",So am I playing a completely different game?

319,leagueoflegends,"Made a few adjustments to make absolutely sure my post is following the League of Legends subreddit rules. Here's to hoping it wont get removed again: 

I know what you're going to say: ""Hey there! Firstly, I'd like to thank you for bringing this issue to our hands - Helping us track the players that need to be reformed is super nice of you, thanks for being an active member of the community"" , sounds about right? It's the default response you get from mailing Riot to report a player. Now I don't go about mailing lightly, I often use the report button in-game and move on the next. I'm mailing Riot when I see behaviour that imo should result in a IP ban from the community, often very racist things, wishing people would kill themselves, or one of the newer ones: ""Hope your entire family dies of corona"".

Let me be very clear, I'm not here to discuss particular cases, but I hope that we as a community could finally have our voices heard and start acting against negative behaviour in our community. When it comes to player privacy we often get the reply from Riot: ""I'm sure you already know about the privacy policy thingy which means that we can't share info about what will happen to other players"". Respecting player privacy is something I really do value and I'm appreciating Riot taking it this seriously, but it feels like Riot is taking ""player privacy"" as an excuse not to protect its community from very toxic behaviour, and it should stop now.

As an ""active member of the community"" I'm not here to rant, I have my own ideas on how to address and solve the issue and I will go into more detail in a bit. But first I want to briefly go over ""smurfs"" as I saw it was brought up a few days ago here on this subreddit. Riot doesn't allow smurf account, completely understandable as it ruins other peoples games. However, being in a smurf game is not a free pass for negative behaviour. Going afk minute 5 should not have a place in this game, wishing people too die should not have a place in this game and racism should not have a place in this game. What troubles me, and the reason why I'm reaching out on these forums is how easy it should be to track down these type of behaviours, without it taking any time of Riot staff.

Smurfs: sharing twitch stream links in lobby should easily be a red flag on a player account, mentioning the word ""smurf"" over and over again should too, leveling an account and going 30/0 on your first game, buying an account and having different behaviour, having multiple accounts on the same IP, all red flags. Now I do understand a single one of these behaviours should not justify an account being banned, but combine several of these and you have a very strong case. I can actually name quite a few top streamers that advertise their smurf accounts over and over and over again, without any actions being taken. Again, not here to talk about particular cases, but I feel Riot is neglecting its responsibility to provide a fair/fun player environment.

Racism: most of the words/sentences used for racism should be so easy to track down with just a few lines of code, red flagging an account for a staff member to look at should result in only banning those who deserve it, why isn't this happening more often?

AFK/Giving up: ""open mid"", ""ff 15"", ""a summoner has disconnected"" I'm sure we all see it at least 20% of the games we're in, often between minute 5 and 10. It absolutely amazes me how often I see this in game. Over the last few months I've seen people reply: ""Enjoy your ban"", getting into a conversation with someone running down lanes with 6 blue sapphire items. ""Riot doesn't ban for this, this is the 30th game I do this"". I couldn't believe it, buying 6 blue sapphire's minute 10 should be so easy for Riot to track and red flag that I couldn't believe it not getting banned. I started writing peoples names down that showed this type of behaviour, looking up their game history after several weeks and noticed they just continued to play, often having the same stats over and over again.

I really hope we can stand up as a community and let Riot know that it's us people that have to sit through these games, allowing 1 of those jerks to continue to play will cause frustration by 50, 100 maybe even 250 of us decent players in the community. If Riot want to respect peoples privacy, be my guest, you don't have to show peoples personal details, just remove these guys from your community.

Now on to the next part, the struggle that Riot might have: Banning people seems great at first but may result in people start/buy a new account. Getting being placed in divisions they don't belong, again ruining other player's their game. If we'd make some minor tweaks to the already in place honor system, with matchmaking taking honor levels into account: You often get honored? You get matched with equally honored players. Getting reported often, Riot investigates and penalising your account, dropping honor level and again getting matched with equally honored player. We can have this system get into negative honor, getting matched with player who also abandon games, give up minute 5, or flame each other, not being reported for several games could get you back to neutral, slowly grinding your way back up to higher honor levels and better gameplay experience. If people try to avoid the honor system by making new accounts, an IP ban should take care of them, forever removing them from your/our community.

I realise that my ideas are probably far from perfect, but I think it's a step into the right direction. I'm absolutely confident that with the help of the community, we can think of a system that provides a healthy player environment for the entire community and bring it to Riot attention.

320,leagueoflegends,"Hi everyone. This is the last email I sent to Riot Games Support. First of all I'd like to thank from my heart Rioter Player Support Specialist ""BeccaBeeYi"" for the answer, for reading my message and for understanding it. This means a lot for me. I will publish my email on Reddit as BeccaBeeYi suggested in the reply, which I will publish in the end of the post. It was not the first time I wrote an email to the support team about this and I left league several times for the same reason.

Before showing the email I'd like to mention u/Irarius with his post that made my day. You can find it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BorisMains/comments/ccm0d3/when\_will\_rito\_finaly\_admit\_bboris\_isnt\_aatrox/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BorisMains/comments/ccm0d3/when_will_rito_finaly_admit_bboris_isnt_aatrox/) 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 **I walk this empty street, on the boulevard of hypocrisy.** 

 

First of all, hi! I'm Tenshi. English is not my first language but I have a serious reason to write this email in English, today 14 April 2020.  
You know, I've already written you about this, I'm sorry to be annoying (and for my English as well).Anyway, I just wanted to say that I'm really sad about this thing.  
This is more like a story. Really, I'm not trying to steal time to you, it's serious, believe me.  
Some days ago I got to play a champion in ARAM. I like ARAMs a lot, that's fine.  
I appreciate how I can try different champions and, sometimes, even though the team comp isn't balanced, it's something that happens. I'm ok with that.  
But, you know, when you get to play THAT champion, everything change. I don't know if you know that feeling, when a champion gives you feelings, like, a lot. When that champion inspires you to do great things and to accomplish them in a glorious way, even aside from the game.  
I mean, we all had our first champion, and our VERY first champion. Our faithful and unique companion. He can give you the fun and such otehr great feelings I cannot find the words to describe them. The reason you start playing a game and the fact how he gives serious motivation with things maybe you already know, but sometimes we all forget. Some philosophy aside from the game.  
It was some years ago back in season 5, Ekko was just released, and soon it would have been Tahm Kench. A friend of mine told me about this fantastic game where heroes with great business and goals fight each other in an endless battle. I have never been in marksmans, shooters or something like that. It just didn't fit me. Oh yeah, I really was into really strong attack speed styles, even today. I wanted to fight with a sword and transcend the limits of this world, life and the risk of death all in once. I tried one of the free trial champions back in the day. I have always been hating red, but he was like calling me as my eyes crossed his. His cool big-ass looking triple blade was just as cool as his fine and elegant, philosophical way of telling the dark and creepy truth inside human's heart, yearning for war, destruction and meaningless blood. The same blood his triple blade yearned, thirsty and, really alive. He fought with no honor, lettiong you meditated about all the human race and history, our true and destructive being humans hiding in our same essence. He fought with glory, giving you the feel you could accomplish everything in life if only you truly believed in that. He fought with this blade, soaking blood from the enemies to heal himself, and hurt himself again, only to deal more damage to the enemy. I was feeling like all the human race's bad things happened in history where inside that process of a little, meaningless character of a videogame. Huh? Meaningless? That was i fought until the big day came.

""What is that champion?""

""Is that a new champion?""

""Noob passive""

""Useless champion""

""That is not even a champion""

""First time I see that champ""

""Mastery 7 really?""

Yeah, it was really annoying for me. Not so much, now that I think of it. But it was kind of annoying. I mean, that champion has been on the shop all that time and you see him only now? In a game after 30 levels? Back when you got less experience to get to level 30. It was really weird and UNFAIR. Such a beautiful voice and an awesome and cool design. He was the max fun to play for me in the game. I mean, I know all these things are not objective, but, come on! You didn't know him only because he wasn't strong! He really was the forgotten! Maybe just like the old Yorick! I will teach you how this champ is strong in this game... Prepare yourself, we are coming to you!

I remember that ""Noob passive"" told by a veigar in a game. He didn't know my champion, he didn't know my passive. So it was a noob passive. A. VEIGAR. PLAYER. TOLD ME THAT.

Ok. Maybe it was a noob passive, I don't know, maybe he was a ""noob champ"" just because he fought with autoattacks (back in the day all autoattacks champions were considered for noobs, I don't know why, but adcarries not... uh? Consistency zero... hypocrites). Or perhaps, he was a noob champ because nobody in LCS or LCE was playing him. However, they can talk as much as they want. I have fun with you my friend, who can separate us? I mean, your winrate is one of the lowest in the game, if I miss your Q which is a skill shot we are more than dead, your W is a bit confusing to understand and it depends on the situation (a Veigar player doesn't know what a situational decision is), your E is pretty much useless and that slow is not as powerful as other crowd controls in the game. Your ultimate just gives you some range and attack speed... you know, if they kite as, we are dead. It's all about that. We are not so strong, I admit it. But that's why you are not a noob champion, don't list to people. We won't reply, as you always say, honour will not save anybody, so we won't lose time replying. Instead, we will fight for our victory and as winners tehy will never forget us! The power of a forgotten and useless champion that beated them! Let's go, my faithful companion.

What? They are changing him? OH, they will try to change his blood bar. That's complicated to handle, I hope they will help him to get know by more people. This is disgusting, Riot didn't touch him for years because he wasn't played. I bet he wasn't played by anyone, he sucks in competitive play! And in normal games in low elo too! It's not like Master Yi!

They changed again something, now he is more like a champion. And some people realized he is in the game! Aahah!

You will never get to gold elo with that thing. He is just a useless champion they should remove from the game. He doesn't do damage, he doesn't apply strong cc, he is just a bad copy of Irelia. She can do everything he can do and lots of times better. By the way, how teh heck do you use his W? He doesn't even have mana... what is that, fury?

Oh yeah, i tried him sometimes. He was very funny full AP. Just jump in and ulti pentakill.

No, I mean, did you like his voice, his lore and background, his mysterious charm, his philosophy...?

No I didn't know he existed until Riot touched him in the last patches. Wait, are you a main? LOOOL

How can Riot let this guy say such things!? 

*“He didn't’ really have a die-hard fan-base,”* 

OF COURSE! YOU LET HIM BE FORGETTEN TO NEVER BALANCE HIM! HYPOCRITICAL!

*“He had people who played him, but even the people we tended to ask who played him weren’t* *super attached to the character.""*

What? How did you know? Did you ask all of his mains in the world? If they weren't so much, why din't you do it?

*""I’m not saying there weren’t die-hard fans, I’m saying his fan base wasn’t like Rengar. Pre-rework Rengar was like a million people saying, ‘All I want to do is play this character.’*

HYPOCRITICAL! Hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical! Of course there were milion people, he was strong! You didn't put affection into one of your coolest champion because he wasn't played enough... you didn't help him to grow his community! Nobody played him because he was not so strong... You created him and after some nerfs after his creation, you never balanced him... How can you say such a thing? How infamous should you be to do such a thing? He was everything for me in this game! He inspired me! We had fun together! And then you do this??  


*""\[...\] play-rate was anemic for years despite having a healthy win rate.”* 

That's not true. I can't find anywhere now the numbers of cours. But you know that's not true. Otherwise there would have been an elo where he would have been played! Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, Challenger, world championships! No! Anywhere! You are just saving your damned ass in front of all the (few) players and (even fewer) mains. How dare you... Why did you do that. Why did you replace him with another champion. His voice was so elegant, now he's a fucking screamer without sense. His only sense is to give sense to the new Rhaast. Fuck that. His blood mechanics are dead. His dash is ridiculous to the limits of the imaginable. There are champions that with one skill can do 3 dashes and his old Q is now in 2 different skills? Why did you kill him. What about his damn fucking cool W that hurt him or healed him? What is that disgusting looking cage. His R? Oh, now you have to ult to get wings, I see. Before replacing him with this puppet, he could fucking fly. He had a cool alive triple blade thirsty of blood. Now, everything is gone. It may be fun to other people, but it's disgusting for people who were really attacked to him, really. No surprise this is considered the worst rework Riot ever had. Good job Jeevun 'Jag' Sidhu. You should publicly apologize. I read all you said about this rework. You are just hypocritical to me, I'm sorry. You said his kit was difficult to balance. How many times did you try to do that. How many patches in the years touched him. How many? Because I played him for a long time, and I know. Wait a second. Autoattacks champions are hard to balance. What about Xin Zhao, Irelia, that were reworked that time. All the reworks Riot has done are fantastic. They could renew the champions but they always kept their main aspects of their previous kit. Just look at Xin, or Fiddlesticks. Riot said (I can't find again the page and the exact words, I'm sorry, but it was in one the most recent reworks) that an important aspect of reworking a champion is to keep the main aspects of its old design such as the kit, innovating it though and solving some of the problems it had. You didn't do it, my friend. Even his passive now is dead, as he can't resurrect. I remember when in a news about URF, or ARURF i think, his passive cool down was decreased because Riot liked to see its animation. I know it's not so relevant as it was written in a funny way, but the guy who wrote it hit my heart with that. It was a proof someone saw him and knew he was alive. Now he is dead. Q is the only thing which stayed. In two new skills. Ok. But Q wasn't his main part of the design. It was his blood bar and W with the passive. And they are gone. Just like my will to play the game. he was finally a good champion in the patches before the rework and they played him in the championship series, the worlds. You could even tell he was OP. One challenger player in Korea asked to not remake him because he saw the rework would have killed the champion.

You replaced him, my friend, my reason I started the game. You killed our dreams. That challenger guy, as I know, quitted the game. So did I.

I returned to teh game after a while. I gave it a new chance. I found new champions to main instead of him. First Vi, then Kha'Zix and Rek'Sai.

I got to Silver 1 in 3 days from Silver 4. The following day teh new season started. New ranks for everybody. Goodbye divisions 5, welcome Grandmaster. My objective was to get to Gold 4. I ranked and ranked and finally got it. After a month I didn't even realize and i got to Platinum 4.

That time I got in the top 300 Rek'Sai players for about one month in EUW server as a Platinum 4 player. Some time later i got to Platinum 3 promo but I lost it. I then stopped playing and made a smurf called Give Aatrox Back, because I wanted to learn and try new champions such as Graves or Lee Sin, but in normal games everybody became toxic and tryharders, more than ranked games. But this was my point of view, and my friends as well. In the smurf I couldn't get fun. All toxic. And all the times I wrote Riot about my old main, no results. I mean, I'm happy with Kha and Rek, they are really funny. But as affection, I really missed that champion. And the disappointment of having seen how it was unfairly blown away together with the joy of playing it by his few fans, broke me.

I started playing again sometimes but only because a new player, a friend of mine, started playing. He mains Karma. Riot, please don't do that to him.

I really can't understand why players didn't know about his existence. I mean, everytime they opened the champion shop, he was in the top, in the first position. There were two 'A' letters in his name. And now they replaced them with two sad 'B's.

He taught me to not lose hope. Never.

Fight or be forgotten. We'll never forget you, our faithful and only Companion.

Hey there Tenshi,

BeccaBeeYi here to assist. I hope you are well.

Firstly, sorry for the delayed response. We have been extremely busy here. With everything that is going on we have more players online and therefore more tickets! We are doing our best 📷

I have read through your heart rendering email and I must say it did pull on my heart strings. Also, although you advised English was not your first language you expressed yourself immensely.

Now you did make me feel your attachment to Aatrox and the bond I feel like you have with him so well. I can understand how you are feeling the way that you are when you have worked with him for so long and had such a strong feeling towards him. I know that reworks are hard for a lot of players when they have got such an affection for characters. The passion you have towards him is heartfelt and I can feel it throughout your email, it made me feel passionate about what you were saying about the changes. I felt like I went on a journey with you. You gave me the feelings that you were feeling, I really felt it!

I can not comment on the words spoken by Jeevun “Jag” Sidhu as they are his words and not mine but I do believe he knew players like you were out there and you were going to be disappointed but I know he was trying to do what was best as a whole. I know it can seem like they do not care about players like you when they rework characters but they do and I know they hope that you can try and work with them on the rebuild.

I know this may not be easy for you though, as you say there is so much difference and it feels like it could have been done in a better way. I can not even begin to know how this has personally effected you, but I can see that it is strongly and I do not want to take away from that as you have every right to feel as you do to a beloved Champion.

Now I am just player support so I do not have any say in these matters, I am looking into where I can send forward this epic email, somewhere that it can be noticed but I can not promise anything. I am trying my best though.

Also, you can express your opinion on boards such as reddit and these sometimes get noticed by devs and such. Again, I can not promise anything but I can tell you that they have replied to stuff on boards before and I am sure they will do it again as they do value opinions.

Thank you for your words and if you need anything else, please let me know.

Have a great day and stay safe 🧡

Sorry Becca if I published your reply without asking, but I think many players and Aatrox mains will appreciate it. Thank you for reading all my email, you are the best and I hope someone in the balance team will read it, or maybe my hero Riot Tryn. I don't expect people to read all of this, but I just wanted to show how the thing is serious. I miss him so much. We miss him so much. And nostalgia is the most beautiful thing in the world.

Any other skirmisher follows that rule. Yas windwall can block a ton of ranged stuff, but not melee attacks and his shield can be poked down. Damage he does is physical - you can build proper armor items against that. Jax is similar - all his offenses and defenses have counter measures.   


Yi? Iframes and tons of true damage. Resistances mean jack, large healthpools mean jack, lading skillshorts means also jack if he's good cause he can just iframe it, kill, get a reset on his skills and iframe again...

Instead they do the same old cookie cutter LCK playstyle of handshaking objectives, and trying to slowly bleed out their opponent with CS leads. To be as blunt as can be, that shit won't work against the chinese teams, nor will it work against G2 especially. 

G2 has perfected recipe to beat teams trying to play the old meta playstyle and have displayed it many many times. TL, SKT, Damwon, OG. All of these teams played slow and risk averse. Don't get me wrong, they all were damn good at it, but they only beat the teams that play the same style, but worse than them. 

SKT had the right idea last worlds, they garnered leads in the early game against G2, but then defaulted to slowly bleeding out G2 with their early lead, which obviously did not work because G2 just forced them with numbers advantage and eventually got back ahead. This surprised the fuck out of me, because GRF showed how to beat G2 and SKT didn't take notes.

I'll include a photo of my most recent match, with me begging my 0/4 Katarina,2/7 Jax and 3/6 Vayne to stop flaming and to play safe, only to be told to ""shut up"", ''0 top and bot''. 

Even if I may be wrong I feel that Riot has ignored low elo (aka the majority of players), and only cares about whats happening in high elo and pro play.Most of my games end with me either winning because I carried, with some help from my team, or flamed by an 0/X teammate till I just mute my team and try to split push to win. While the biggest problem still remains, even when I report them, for exactly the things they did, NOONE gets banned. I have reported more than 200 players, for griefing or flaming, and not once have I seen a notification about one of my reports being analyzed and theplayer getting banned.  


TL;DR: Riot is ignoring the majority of its players (aka bronze/silver), games are filled with trolls, flamers, and really really bad players, and reports do nothing

351,leagueoflegends,"First, I am absolutely not saying Nasus is op or bla bla. He has clear weaknesses and even if he goes 3/0 out of lane that doesnt mean you lost the game (although he'll likely 3 shot your adc when he gets there). I think the buff for his W was very unnecessary, but again, he isnt op.

However, Nasus is not that easy to deal with on lane as you might expect, considering every 3 seconds he gets stronger with yet another stack on his Q. Nasus is weak until he is level 6. Then he first is okay, with sheen becomes a threat and with his first item winning a 1v1 vs him is hard. I play Fiora and I dance around him with my Lunges, hitting all the spots but he Qs me 4-5 Times (healing himself every time) and I am practically dead. 

Even pre 6 it's not that easy. Yeah you deny him farm but you dont really have kill pressure. You walk up to him, he Ws you which (unless you're Garen) ends the trade and he walks away. And then he has his passive so he's full health rather quickly. You can be up 40cs by 12min and it doesnt really change anything when it comes to 1v1s on the top lane. For winning the 1v1 Nasus doesnt even need 400stacks at 20min. He can half of that and still do scary dmg.

I think I give up on picking fighters into Nasus, at least until I find a solution to this. Is it picking ignite over teleport? Is it going way more aggressive early? Is it telling your jungler to camp the dog?

With tanks like Maokai it's pretty ok to lane vs Nasus. You won't kill him but he won't kill you either",It's a bit frustrating to see how strong Nasus' laning phase actually is when he's supposed be THE late game toplaner

372,leagueoflegends,"I know what you're going to say: ""Hey there! Firstly, I'd like to thank you for bringing this issue to our hands - Helping us track the players that need to be reformed is super nice of you, thanks for being an active member of the community"" , sounds about right? It's the default response you get from mailing Riot to report a player. Now I don't go about mailing lightly, I often use the report button in-game and move on the next. I'm mailing Riot when I see behaviour that imo should result in a IP ban from the community, often very racist things, wishing people would kill themselves, or one of the newer ones: ""Hope your entire family dies of corona"". 

Let me be very clear, I'm not here to discuss particular cases, but I hope that we as a community could finally put the pressure on Riot and EUW server in particular to start acting. When it comes to player privacy we often get the reply from Riot:  ""I'm sure you already know about the privacy policy thingy which means that we can't share info about what will happen to other players"". Respecting player privacy is something I really do value and I'm appreciating Riot taking it this seriously, but it feels like Riot is taking ""player privacy"" as an excuse not to protect its community from very toxic behaviour, and it should stop now.

As an active ""active member of the community"" I'm not just here to rant, I have my own ideas on how to address and solve the issue and I will go into more detail in a bit. But first I want to briefly go over ""smurfs"" as I saw it was brought up a few days ago here on this subreddit. Riot doesn't allow smurf account, completely understandable as it ruins other peoples games. However, being in a smurf game is not a free pass for negative behaviour. Going afk minute 5 should not have a place in this game, wishing people too die should not have a place in this game and racism should not have a place in this game. What troubles me, and the reason why I'm reaching out on these forums is how easy it should be to track down these type of behaviours, without it taking any time of Riot staff.

Smurfs: sharing twitch stream links in lobby should easily be a red flag on a player account, mentioning the word ""smurf"" over and over again should too, leveling an account and going 30/0 on your first game, buying an account and having different behaviour, having multiple accounts on the same IP, all red flags. Now I do understand a single one of these behaviours should not justify an account being banned, but combine several of these and you have a very strong case. I can actually name quite a few top streamers that advertise their smurf accounts over and over and over again, without any actions being taken. Again, not here to talk about particular cases, but I feel Riot is neglecting its responsibility to provide a fair/fun player environment.

Racism: most of the words/sentences used for racism should be so easy to track down with just a few lines of code, red flagging an account for a staff member to look at should result in only banning those who deserve it, why isn't this happening more often? 

AFK/Giving up: ""open mid"", ""ff 15"", ""a summoner has disconnected"" I'm sure we all see it at least 20% of the games we're in, often between minute 5 and 10. It absolutely amazes me how often I see this in game. Over the last few months I've seen people reply: ""Enjoy your ban"", getting into a conversation with someone running down lanes with 6 blue sapphire items. ""Riot doesn't ban for this, this is the 30th game I do this"". I couldn't believe it, buying 6 blue sapphire's minute 10 should be so easy for Riot to track and red flag that I couldn't believe it not getting banned. I started writing peoples names down that showed this type of behaviour, looking up their game history after several weeks and noticed they just continued to play, often having the same stats over and over again. 

I really hope we can stand up as a community and let Riot know that it's us people that have to sit through these games, allowing 1 of those jerks to continue to play will cause frustration by 50, 100 maybe even 250 of us decent players in the community. If Riot want to respect peoples privacy, be my guest, you don't have to show peoples personal details, just remove these guys from your community. 

Now on to the next part, the struggle that Riot might have: Banning people seems great at first but may result in people start/buy a new account. Getting being placed in divisions they don't belong, again ruining other player's their game. If we'd make some minor tweaks to the already in place honor system, with matchmaking taking honor levels into account: You often get honored? You get matched with equally honored players. Getting reported often, Riot investigates and penalising your account, dropping honor level and again getting matched with equally honored player. We can have this system get into negative honor, getting matched with player who also abandon games, give up minute 5, or flame each other, not being reported for several games could get you back to neutral, slowly grinding your way back up to higher honor levels and better gameplay experience. If people try to avoid the honor system by making new accounts, an IP ban should take care of them, forever removing them from your/our community. 

I realise that my ideas are probably far from perfect, but I think it's a step into the right direction. I'm absolutely confident that with the help of the community, we can think of a system that provides a healthy player environment for the entire community and bring it to Riot attention. The best time to act was yesterday, the second best today. Do something Riot.",EUW issues should be addressed

I brought up the topic of ""elo hell"" which in context to myself, means that the outcome of the game is no longer up to which team performs better, more which team has somebody whos not trying to lose on purpose.

400,leagueoflegends,"I understand the ""Recommended Items"" tab in the shop which is built for every champion in the game. But I think it should not be there after you reach level 30. 

The reason is everyone should start to learn and understand what certain items do and how to play around them, but as long as there is this part of the shop, so many people will not know the powerspikes each item represent up untill later in their experience.

Of course, begginers should be given this tab to help them and lift the item weight off their mind, and allows  them to focus on the basis of the game. But so many people build what is shown in that tab, and it is not viable in every single matchup. Moreover, the recommended items on some champions are not ideal.

Also, without this help, there would be a much higher skill ceiling across all elos. You need to have a solid knowledge about your champion and the items in order to built something correctly. Ofc, there are sites like op.gg and mobafire that show you build paths, but at least it instigates the player to search and find more things about core items and situational build, whereas in the ingame shop, something like that is merely shown.

411,leagueoflegends,"I dont know if its the matchmaking or what but this game is unholy unfair. I am learning and leveling an account which takes a considerable amount of time. I am learning the game with my wife as well, we are just spamming normal and blind picks.  


I downloaded facecheck for builds and it consistently shows the people we play against are consistently plat and diamond playing with their ""friends"" in normals. This one person will end up carrying the whole game and rofl stomp us all and i can't even comprehend any gameplay because this player will roll all 5 of us. Just today, it has happened 5-6 games out of 10. We even had a grandmaster smurf on the team university of cincinatti smurfing to play with his friend and he just shat on us.  


It is so unfun playing against people that absolutely roll your whole team. You don't even know what to do besides FF, and most people won't FF. When there are diamonds and grandmasters that are just going 10 and 0 in the first 15 mins, the game is practically over unless they go brain dead.  


I think riot seriously needs to come up with a better matchmaking system for normals. I can't imagine ranked with the toxicity I hear from it and this game is seriously turning me away just based on simple, fixable matters.   


This game rocks in gameplay wise and its fun when you play a hard fought game and either win or lose. But when the game is over from the start, its full of toxic people, and its hard to FF.. There is no fun in it.  


TLDR: Game is inherently unfun based off its matchmaking and players. Its so easy for a smurf thats high ranked to smash games and you can't even gather anything from the game. Its happening more and more and turning away newer players. I'd rather play a different game than roll the dice and get a diamond player smurfing for fun with ""friends""",New player. Game is extremely unfun.

Since they're obviously better than the elo they're smurfing on and are not playing on their main account (which makes them not care about losses or reports) they act in all their arrogance; like they were the messiah in our ""trash"" elo, gifting us the LP - but also willing to take it away from us at any given moment, should we not cooperate in adoration. 

Who hasn't had a smurf in their game who got autofilled or simply didn't like something and immediately started threatening the own team with trolling/inting/afk'ing. How is it fair to be kept hostage by a player who knows he's better and can singlehandedly win or throw a game? For any player who's in it for fun or for the grind can't even be honestly happy for the win. Because it's not earned. It's not fought for, it's gifted by a smurf who most probably looks down on you - maybe even flames you in the process. Calling you stupid for trying your best (which obviously isn't as good as his best).

459,leagueoflegends,"Hi, this is my take on why I believe voice communication is a necessity and it is atrocious that it is not in the game already. 

First of all, I would like to talk about League of Legends solo q as a whole. 5 players playing different roles with different functions are put into a game against 5 other players. Both teams are attempting at the same goal, to destroy the enemy nexus. The most important part of League of Legends is teamwork. Being able to work together must forgo to achieve the goal you are sharing with your team. League of Legends is a team game. 

Team games require each other to work together. However, the only tools we are given to achieve such a feat are pings and typing in chat. These are not enough as comms allow for much more information given and got. Information is key in League of Legends as each player is piloting a different perspective that allows different information to solely you. Being able to disclose such information is the first step in teamwork and team play. Such is why voice communication is so important in team play. The fact that we have no access to a vigorous communication system such as voice comms, we as solo q players are unable to work together wholly as we could. 

Every tier on the ladder would benefit from having voice communications. These are the reasons why  I believe so.

The level of play would exponentially grow the higher on the ladder you went. Players would be able to grow more efficiently by having access to different perspectives of the players they are playing with.  Games in solo q are known to be a mess. But sometimes they are not and the majority of those times are simply because everyone is on the same page. High tier play as in Diamond and above would increase heavily as these players are accustomed to their understanding of League of Legends and are able to make smart decisions...in the majority of the time. 

Voice communications would directly result in a better quality of solo q. This is a subject voiced and opinionated by many as complaints of the ladder, especially in high elo, are quite frequent. North American Solo q is commonly understood as being inferior to the bigger regions such as EUW and KR.  Some of the common phrases describing solo q in NA is a ""for fun region"". Levelling up the play in high elo solo q would not only deny the idea of solo q in NA being for fun but also increase the average motivation for players wanting to win. 

Communication is a motivator for players wanting to win. By tearing down a layer of privacy and using your voice to communicate, players are automatically more invested in winning. Communicating with your team regarding the game and how to play it is proof of your investment that you want to win. This idea will directly result in a more positive experience. 

Now unto the most debated topic, toxicity. 

Emil Nordlander, states in his Thesis on "" The different emotional effects of voice and text communication in a game environment,"" that ""People acted/reacted more relaxed and cheerful and could easily chat and understand and support each other when using voice chat."" Public voice chat in League of Legends will not be without toxic individuals however it will be at a lower percentage than a simple chat box which we have now. Flaming in-game by typing is a lot easier than flaming via voice chat. By removing that layer of privacy you are more involved and invested in the game, thus directly lowering the chance of aggressively flaming your teammates. 

I personally love League of Legends. I think it is meant to be played as a team and not as an individual. Terms like ""1v9"" only exist because there's an idea that you are also playing against your teammates. Why not play with your teammates to the full extent as its meant to be done anyway?",Voice Comms in Solo q is a Necessity

508,leagueoflegends,"Right now, the majority of competitive games and even high elo matches do not contain an assassin. I feel like this is a little problematic when you look at, for example, Marksmen. Almost 100% of games contains at least 1 Marksman, to the point that the pickrate of them is probably over 120%. If Marksmen are the weakest role in the game and still have over a 100% pickrate, then what hope do worse classes like assassins and tanks have? Tanks should also probably receive buffs as well.

Personally, I would look into adding Deathfire Grasp back into the game and buffing Frozen Heart to further increase its attack speed slow or the radius of the aura. Randuins could also reduce crits by a lot more, perhaps 20% or 25%. What do you think?",Should the assassin class receive major buffs considering how low their pickrate is?

512,leagueoflegends,"I am honestly baffled from the current state of this game, and I have no idea who or where to have these issues discussed so can we have an actual discussion about the current state of the game?

I've been playing this game since around season 2 or 3, and something just changed since 3 or 4 years ago.

The quality of the game has been very unpleasant. Toxic players(in terms of action not words since most are banned being verbally toxic), people not trying, giving up, one-sided matches, and etc seem to flood the game, particularly ranked matches.

Recently this game takes about 1-3 minutes to even login, and it just feels like Riot has abandoned this game. I understand Valorant being a priority since it's their new game, but it just feels terrible feeling like they do not really care about the playerbase for League of Legends anymore. This is ironic because of how much work and praise they put into the competitive scene in global scale...

One of the main reason I wanted to write a post is because of how my relationship with my brother became stale. He lives far away, and one of the ways we really connected was playing games together. He's busy with his life, so he is limited in his game time and choice of games. We used to play duo queue a lot, but over the course of few years, it's just either a one stomp win or unwinnable matches due to the teammates being so vastly different in skills. This makes the game seriously unenjoyable, and also forces players to play only certain champions to take advantage of having a higher chance to win. Because of these conditions, what became laughs, thrills, and excitement just became ""oh well, it's just how it is, and ...silence."" Most of my friends that I played this game since high school do not even play it anymore, and I think that really says a lot. Not because they do not like this game, but they do not like the system and structure of the game. It is mostly just frustration.

As someone that's been playing this game and has been supporting this games for years in terms of money and being a fan, what is going on? Have we as players done something to deserve such low game quality? At this point it does not seem like we can do anything to make it better, but a long erosion-like effect that just destroyed the joy in this game. 

TLDR: It feels like Riot has abandoned this game. Terrible matchmaking, playerbase, and client/gamequality. I just want to know why and how the quality of this game deteriorated so much, and if it is ever possible to make it more enjoyable again.",Why is League going downhill despite it's strong e-sport presence?
513,leagueoflegends,"What's your favorite skinline and why? ( Star Guardian, Project etc )

I personally like Pool Party line the most since everyone looks so colorful, happy and having a good time. Even though i don't like default Lee animations, i think Pool Party Lee has one of the coolest recalls in the game + a very cool Q animation. Pool MF and Cait are just hot, pretty much everyone agrees on that + they have a very satisfying autoattack sound.

Graves looks like the most badass dude at the entire pool and Lulu looks like a walking umbrella.

516,leagueoflegends,"So today I got into my first ranked solo game as a level 30 player. Dont get me wrong I was playing really bad and played my worst game as my main so far.

But anyways. I got into picking and banning champions when the first trash talking started when I had the wrong items and my team mates already wanted to report me (keep in mind not everyone had picked their champs yet) 

Then we got in to the fight and even before the minions had spawned my team mates were already trash talking more about me. And it continued throughout the game until the end. At the end there was a hope of spark when the enemy team said that I had played well for a level 30. Btw the top laner I was matched up with was a level 197 Darius and some of the enemy players were close to level 300.

All I'm saying is that this kind of community drives away potential and puts some people down. Dont do that. Especially when you, as a trash talker are a level 250 gold IV.",Trash talking
517,leagueoflegends,"This idea I understand would be a pretty big undertaking, maybe not possible in some cases, and maybe just wouldn’t ever be worth the time for them, but I like it.

Recently I’ve been playing pretty much only Azir, who as of now is by far my favourite champion in the game and the only one I really have fun with anymore. To me he’s everything  I could ever want him to be as a champ. But I really really do miss old Azir, where the shurima shuffle was actually something to be seen and he had real proper range. I understand somewhat that this makes him more balanced and less frustrating to play against, but it really does feel like a big loss to me. Not really in power as it allowed riot to give him a bit more real power without him becoming overbearing but it makes me almost as sad now as it did when they first put it out. While at that point I did just quit the game for a while and when I came back didn’t touch Azir for a good amount of time eventually I took another break from league and now that I’m back I’m liking Azir again, even if it doesn’t feel quite the same. 

This must be I assume the case for a lot of people with their mains that have been changed, especially those that have been fully reworked. I think it’d be nice to at least have the chance to use them in the state we liked them the most in, and had the most fun with. Obviously I don’t expect this to happen but I do hope somehow it’s possible.",Riot should add something in the practice tool or maybe customs that lets you play as past iterations of champions

520,leagueoflegends,"First let me preface this by saying I'm a massive DL fan and a lover of the 2016 TSM team. After listening to the latest Summoning Insight podcast, around 47 minutes into the video, I think I agree with MonteCristo here. 

As a fan of traditional sports, mainly the NBA and European Football/Soccer, this seems like a move that would normally be veto'ed. I find that TL going 9th after sweeping 4 titles and then running to a team which his girlfriend runs, where that very girlfriend is the ex of the owner as well as the fact DL left TSM on bad terms, a series of very suspicious coincidences. Monte makes a good point, you don't know what's going on behind the scenes and you can make some nefarious inferences based on what happened, but the true problem is that this situation is allowed to exist in the first place. In traditional sports, this would never happen because all signs point to blatant nepotism and tampering, not to mention the fact that there are glaring conflict of interests with this move. I don't even blame DL for this situation but shouldn't we see red flags when TL wins 4 straight titles (one of them reverse sweeping TSM), and suddenly Regi breaks up with Leena, then Leena is dating DL half a year ago. Obviously I am making many assumptions about what's happening behind the scenes but memes aside, how are people not noticing the massive red flags throughout this timeline? 

To make a NBA comparison, why is this not met with same outrage as  Kawhi Leonard making Paul George force himself out of a team he has publicly stated to commit heavily to. Sure this trade makes for more competition in LCS, but this is actually a terrible trade for all 3 parties involved. For TL, their chemistry and superteam is destroyed, for TSM, they are actually in a loss-loss situation because, if they perform poorly, their reputation will take a hit due to how they treated Kobbe and they perform well and DL returns to his championship form, this basically goes to reinforce Monte's suggestion of DL sandbagging his season to get himself traded. For the LCS overall, this damages their image as a credible body for sports because they are allowing a conflict of interest to exist, setting a precedent and undoing all the progress to try make their Esport be seen as equals to mainstream sports. People will meme that the LCS, TSM and TL are all terrible image-wise anyway, but this will be the nail in the coffin.",Perhaps MonteCristo is right in the DoubleLift situation.

534,leagueoflegends,"With RNG &amp; EDG facing off today in Round 1 of the LPL 2020 Spring Playoffs I thought I'd throw out some fun bits of information to tease the upcoming matchup.  


**The Story of the Matchup:**  


**RNG:** Established August 2012 (As Royal Club).   
**H2H Championships Won**:   
2016 Spring Finals 3-1  
2018 Spring Finals 3-1

**Playoff Games Won vs RNG:**  
2017 Spring Semi Finals 3-1

**EDG:** Established September 2013.   
**H2H Championships won:**   
2016 Summer Finals vs RNG 3-0  
2017 Summer Finals vs RNG 3-2 (Watch this)  

**Playoff Games Won vs RNG:**   
None

&amp;#x200B;

* This is the second time that RNG and EDG have versed each other in Playoffs where it was not the Finals. The only time RNG and EDG have ever versed outside of the Final was 2017 Spring Semis. This is the first time in history that these two will face in the First Round. 
* They haven’t faced each other in Playoffs since 2018 Spring which was the Finals in which RNG beat EDG 3-1 and went on to win MSI.
* All of last year EDG and RNG were on opposite sides of the bracket. The last time EDG and RNG were on the same side of the Bracket was 2017 Spring. 
* RNG 2-1 EDG in the Regular Season (Remember they only face once in a BO3 per split)  


**RNG 7th Seed:**  


* This is the first split in history that Uzi has not played a single game/at least half while being on a starting position on a roster. He is also not starting today vs EDG (While he can still sub in for Game 2 and beyond - he is still eligible to play)
* RNG have lost 5 out of their 6 last series - they were all bottom tier teams. RNG had the easiest schedule of anyone in the final two weeks and failed massively.
* RNG however, beat 5 out of 7 of the top 8 teams in playoffs. As said by Heresmilo on my stream ""RNG are the Robin Hood of the LPL"" - They took from the rich and gave to the poor (They beat teams higher than them and lost to those that were lower)   


  
**EDG 6th Seed:**

* This is EDG’s 3rd split in a row starting in Round 1 of Playoffs. 
* EDG lost to 5 out of 7 of the other top 8 teams in playoffs in the regular season
* Last year was not kind to EDG with their worst placing combined in history - 7th in Spring, out in Round 1 playoffs. 5th in Summer and out in Quarter Finals vs BLG. Last year was the first year in history since their inception that they did not go to Worlds. EDG starting in Round 1 adds to their lowest placements in history.
* EDG have never missed playoffs in the LPL since the birth of their organisation.  


Whenever these two meet it's always a banger, I expect you all to be there on time, RAIN HAIL OR SHINE!

539,leagueoflegends,"I made [a post about this](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/f2kcy5/other_champions_that_could_use_the_vfx_update/) before, back when Annie and Nautilus were about to receive their own VFX updates last year, but I thought I'd bring the topic back since, like I said, clarity is important (it also helps that these updates include brand new VFX on skins whose prices demand them to have excluvise effects), most champions I'm bringing up are from the old post, but I'll add some new ones, specially if you guys remind me:

**Brand -** His fire moves look very dated. In addition to that, his E's range could be more clear, and his Ultimate looks very discreet during a teamfight, it feels like it should bring more attention considering how dangerous it can be.

**Elise -** Her human Q is barely noticeable, her human W could use a better range clarification, and maybe better animations, I think the spiderling feels kinda robotic, and her spider W could use better indication of usage, since the effects of her activating it are very discreet.

**Malzahar -** His Q may be a question of personal preference, but it looks like a breeze hitting enemies, which is pretty bad considering the damage it deals, though it definitely needs a better area indicator, his E could be more obvious, since its hard to notice during a teamfight, and the AOE from his Ultimate could look a little more threatening, most people don't seem to even notice that it actually deals damage. Also, Overlord Malzahar's price seems to indicate it should have additional effects, I think black ones would look really cool.

**Nidalee -** For the ammount of damage it deals (which is a LOT), her human Q needs to look a lot more threatening than a simple spear throw, her human W has little to no indication that it deals damage over time and her human E could look a little brighter as well. Her cougar abilities could all have better range indicators, particularly her W. Also, Bewitching Nidalee could have better effects than leaving just a trail of bats, seriously, outside of her human Q, none of the other abilities seems to have anything more than that stupid little trail.

**Trundle -** While his W and E seem to be fine, his Q could use an indication that it reduced the enemy's AD, as well as better indication that it increased his own, his Ultimate needs to be much more obvious, since he is stealing both health and protections from his target, and sometimes you kinda have to guess because the link from him to the target is so discreet.

**Twisted Fate -** VFX are, in general, outdated, his Q is very discreet, particularly in teamfights, his W is clear above his head, but the projectiles themselves could be more noticeable, and his E's projectile barely seems different than a regular basic attack. In addition to that, High Noon and Underworld skins have no special effects on their own, which doesn't fit their price.

**Udyr -** Udyr needs a lot more than VFX updates, since his kit, model and animations are outdated, but assuming we won't receive updates to those: all ability effects are incredibly outdated, none of them are particularly clear either, they're more noticeable in some skins, because they change with each ability, but in others, like his classic one, the changes are very discreet, his R's AOE in particular, is unclear and needs to be more specific. Primal and Definitely Not Udyr skins don't have effects matching their price either.

**Vayne -** Her VFX are also kinda outdated, the empowered attack from her Q could use better clarification, her W is also particularly discreet in teamfights and her E looks kinda ugly in general. Dragonslayer and Heartseeker also don't have specific effects fitting of their price.

Now, for the new additions to this list:

**Rammus -** VFX are very outdated in general, his Q isn't too bad, since the model changes, but looking better wouldn't hurt, his W looks very old and his E and R are very discreet, specially in teamfights, I'll bring attention to the R specifically, because it's a big AOE and sometimes you don't even notice it is active, not to mention there is little, if any, indication that it hits towers at all. Also, Ninja Rammus and Molten Rammus should have different VFX based on their price.

**Hecarim -** While his Q has no clarity issues, it certainly looks pretty ugly nowadays, also, calling his W ""discreet"" is understating it, there is very little indication of its presence, so you don't even notice its dealing damage or healing, when it should be clear that is doing both, also, his E might be obvious due to the speed increase, but could still use better effects. His Ult is very noticeable, but considering how powerful it is, it should be more clear, the phantoms are a little too transparent. Reaper and Blood Knight skins don't have different effects.

**Orianna -** Pretty much anything in Orianna's kit needs to be a little more noticeable, from the movement trail of the ball in her Q and E, to the detonation and slow field of her W, to her E's shield. Her R is decent enough, but is kinda hard to notice the range, and could be more clear as well. Hell, even her basic attacks should have better indication of the damage increase of her passive and they're already hard to notice on their own. Also, Bladecraft Orianna should have different effects.

I probably missed some, sorry if the latest ones are kinda lazily written, I'm kinda sleepy right now, again, I bring these up because its a good way to keep the game polished, because many of these champions aren't gonna receive full VGUs or even model updates, but that doesn't mean their abilities shouldn't look better for clarity's sake.","Several champions need VFX updates, I know the situation with COVID-19 probably makes this lower in priority, but it's always a good thing to remember the champions that need this, because clarity is important"
540,leagueoflegends,"Hey guys I'm not very knowledgeable about the game. I play a lot of support.   


Recently i have been trying top out and i noticed something that i never noticed before. As a top laner i can hit level 6 and bot lane is only like level 4? I think i didn't notice before because i am so focused on the laning phase that i didn't pay attention to what level our top laner was as a support.  


Anyway once i found this out i started saving my tele and then using it bot lane a soon as i hit 6 and double kill bot. This strategy has worked really well for me as i didn't really have to sacrifice anything to do this, maybe i lose a plate if im unlucky. its lead to me having at least a significant gold lead on enemy laner and snow balling bot lane, especially if i get to do it again or another 2 times during lane pahse. ive won so many top games since i started doing this and only 1 other top laner i have played against did this strat, 9 times out of 10 the other top laner doesn't even follow. I'm not sure if its because he doesn't have tele or he just doesn't care.  


Anyway I'm really curios to know why the exp and levels are like this? Why is this how the game works? If anyone can link me to some articles or dev posts that talk about this so i can read up about it and the reasoning behind it i'd really appreciate it.

543,leagueoflegends,"So Yasuo has had the highest banrate of any champion ever since he was creates. His Windwall feels frustrating because it doesn't take up a lot of skill to use and stays for way too long. 

My suggestion is to put it on a 2 charge system and make it only last for 1 second.

This would allow the Yasuo player higher skill expression by giving them more cast and needing to use it reactively to stop skillshots or AA's, but wouldn't allow them to just completely nullify and kite ADCs or heavy skillshot champions like Orianna around their wall. 

It would also fit his theme much better because the ""Wind wall"" would be a brief barrier of air created by his powerful strikes.

The number of charges, cooldowns between usage, and Wind Wall duration could all be tuned over time to feel fairer

549,leagueoflegends,"I was recently playing a game with my friend when I said “this game is lost; I don’t want to play it anymore.” He said that he still wanted to play through and see the nexus fall, as the game was still marginally winnable. He later explained that majority of people, on both the winning and losing side, would want to see the game through. I fought that by saying, although poorly, the amount of time and effort to turn a hard loss into a win would be to large and we might as well go into a new, fresh game. I wanted to see who was more accurate, so here’s the poll:

597,leagueoflegends,"I've been seeing a lot more Sett in the bot lane recently and with that comes a lot of people not really knowing what they're doing once they get there.  Because of this, I played a Sett Support game, made some clips, and want to explain a few ideas that will improve a lot of people's gameplay (hopefully).

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: This is not a guide for Sett top. Sett top and Sett Support do not have the same goals. In addition, I do not play Sett regularly at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Runes:**  [https://imgur.com/a/vFrQWcD](https://imgur.com/a/vFrQWcD) 

Predator is essential because Sett needs speed to position himself correctly.

Some people take omnistone, but I don't find it that useful so I don't. Plus, the real benefit from the Inspiration page for Sett is only Hextch Flashtraption. Speaking of which:

&amp;#x200B;

**Laning:** 

Sett's main goal in the bot lane is to get level 3 and then start looking to all-in with the following combo: 

1. Hextech Flash from the bush (or just normal Flash if you have it)
2. Use Q for the movement speed towards the enemy champions for positioning
3. Use E to stun at least the ADC (the creeps will now start to attack you)
4. Keep in range of the ADC, autoing and tanking everything.
5. Right before you could die, use W to not only gain a shield that will protect you, but also do tons of damage to the enemy ADC. Also ignite them if you have it.
6. Run away immediately. Either your adc can clean up, or they wont and you need to get out anyway.

Here's a clip of this in action for First Blood: [https://youtu.be/uUgeAtnzlhA](https://youtu.be/uUgeAtnzlhA)

&amp;#x200B;

**Items:** 

For Sett Top, it looks like a lot of people are going BotRK and Black Cleaver. That's completely wrong here. 

Steel Shoulderguards &lt; Boots &lt; Merc Treads &lt; Righteous Gloary &lt; Deadman's Plate &lt; Gargoyle Stoneplate

As I've stated above, movement speed is the #1 requirement on Sett because of positioning. Before you have any items, Hextch Flashtraption and Predator will help aid in this matter, but they alone are not enough.

First, I like to get brown boots (predator), followed immediately by Merc treads. Tenacity is king. The general move speed here will help with the combo listed above.

Next is Righteous Glory. ""But Sett doesn't use the 300 mana is gives."" That doesn't mean Sett can't use the item. The active and other states more than make up for this. 

After you have Righteous Glory, you can successfully start a lot more fights, but even this isn't enough later in the game. That's why the next item is Deadman's plate. With both of these, you should be able to start any fight you want, manipulate the situation to your will, and keep-up with the enemy champions afterwards (or run away) with Deadman's speed.

After this, a Gargoyle Stoneplate can help make Sett's large health bar, or the shield gained from his W, be more useful.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gameplay Concepts:** 

USING SETT'S ULT CORRECTLY:

Sorry, I got a little heated there. I always see Setts using their ult incorrectly. Yes, if you ult a tank and land them on an adc it does a lot of damage, but that's not how Sett's ult should be used in the support position.  Damage is not the point at all.

There's two main ways to us it as a support: 

1. Peel someone off of your ADC. 
2. *Bringing someone* ***back*** *to your team*. Specifically, the squishier the target (mid, adc, etc.) the better.

Again, the point here is positioning and CC, not damage. 

1 is pretty easy.

2 is something I NEVER see Setts do other than myself. Normally, they start fighting, ult someone important away from the team fight, and then die alone with the entire enemy team around them because no one was able to keep up to help assist.

What I'm talking about is this:

[https://youtu.be/t4yXs8ysmXw](https://youtu.be/t4yXs8ysmXw)

or this

[https://youtu.be/gAl4aK08WWM](https://youtu.be/gAl4aK08WWM)

**OR THIS**

[**https://youtu.be/1ft2vsS2jyc**](https://youtu.be/1ft2vsS2jyc)

These are the way they Sett's ult should be used to start-up a fight.

Now, all these clips highlight the importance of using Sett's ult to bring people back towards your team, but that doesn't *necessarily* mean you should never use Sett's Ult if it doesn't. For example: 

When chasing: [https://youtu.be/IZlVCIuNBkY](https://youtu.be/IZlVCIuNBkY). Here I keep up with Akali and use the 99% 1 second slow to keep her around long enough for Zed to come finish her off.

When chasing again: [https://youtu.be/q2O2p4OCdgY](https://youtu.be/q2O2p4OCdgY). Here, no one was going to catch the Ornn, so I did.

&amp;#x200B;

But what you **don't** want to do is make a mistake like this: [https://youtu.be/cVQJxzoVAX4](https://youtu.be/cVQJxzoVAX4). This incorrect use of Sett's ult (which moved the fight to outside of the tower range) cost me 1, maybe 2 kills and almost killed me in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, you can also use his ult to the advantage of other players' abilities. Like this: [https://youtu.be/gQCBvdB4XLI](https://youtu.be/gQCBvdB4XLI)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Note:** 

BE CREATIVE! 

In that last clip, lured people via sit-ups. Sit-ups, my guy. I also took advantage of an opportunity I saw and ran with it. With that in mind, I hope these last two clips are able to impart some inspiration:

Like using Q to clear control wards in 4 easy punches and then tossing a Garen over a wall: [https://youtu.be/uA4WaslwGPA](https://youtu.be/uA4WaslwGPA)

  
Or seeing the perfect chance to turn a losing fight in your favor: [https://youtu.be/fyV8hUkSLjk](https://youtu.be/fyV8hUkSLjk)

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully that's enough to get at least some players to use Sett differently in the bot lane. Or, give him a try if they hadn't yet.

This is beyond absurd and as a consumer I feel Riot has not taken the necessary steps as a company to combat the negative impact of this sort of troll behavior.

641,leagueoflegends,"So here's a story for y'all. I'm in the middle of my day, spamming some ranked games having a good time when I get into a game and notice that I've got a limit on the number of messages I can say. I thought that was weird, as I'd never been chat restricted before and couldn't remember anything I'd done that would warrant such action, but I played out my ranked game with fewer comms than normal and relaunched my game to see what I'd been flagged for. 

I get presented with the following two games of chat logs:

 

Game 1

In-Game

ME: top leash pref

&amp;#x200B;

I read through these and was kinda like okay, fine. I guess I told two people to 'shut the fuck up' or said that they had 'EU teeth' and while it feels a little harsh, it probably violates Riot's code of conduct somewhere. So I submitted a support ticket asking for clarification on what my specific offense was, and how they'd like me to deal with situations in the future. I thought not much of it, and didn't expect it to get looked at whatsoever to be completely honest. I had kinda accepted it and moved on.

To my surprise, I got a response back from Riot in about a day and a half. It goes as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/krrxautchhu41.png?width=585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7abcb9e6a943d5be54a6c67f5796957ac24e4eb7

I read this and thought huh, how many times did I ask for someone to get reported in those games? Once. Halfway through the first game, I asked for my AFK Irelia to be reported. I reached out again to Riot Support to clarify that this was the reason for the chat restriction and got the response as follows.

 

https://preview.redd.it/hg1udj57ihu41.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09d22f99058dedf25ca7442ef56e70f81f3349d4

Let me make this clear: I am not asking for some sort of subreddit outroar to try and get my punishment lifted. I'm wondering if these are steps that Riot is starting to take to try and quell something that they deem as toxic. I still see quite a lot of this happen in my ranked games and was wondering if any of y'all had been issued a similar punishment.",You can be chat restricted for asking someone to be reported

660,leagueoflegends,"I think the trade comes down to two main environmental factors, and nothing to do with odds of winning NA or worlds.

1. we are about to head into a serious recession thanks to the pandemic.
2. Doublelift will be able to negotiate his contract on the open market after 6 months.

This leaves TL with 3 options.

**A:** keep DL till his contract expires, pay him enough to re-sign without going to market.**B:** Keep DL till his contract expires, let him go to market, and either pay for another ADC or pay market prices for DL**C:** Trade DL ASAP

**Option A**  results in having to pay a huge salary, but keeping the best ADC in the  region and a huge brand+sponsorship pull for the org. Problem is,  paying that kind of salary when the economy is in the trash 6 months  from now is financially unsustainable.

**Option B:**  High risk. Either keep DL when nobody can pay him, pay him MORE because  you're competing with other offers, or lose him and end up paying  market price for another ADC. Could result in a huge loss of both talent  and money. Still have to pay full price for DL into the recession.

**Option C:**  objective downgrade to competitive and brand assets. In no world is  tactical or any other NA ADC who you want on your roster instead of  Doublelift. BUT, you get to cash out on Doublelift at full contract  value. You can set up a high value trade. You're insulated from the  blowout of cutting DL because of his bad split, and you don't have to  pay an insanely expensive player right before a recession.

Ask  me? this move signals that Liquid is hella smart, setting up a budget  roster and financial sustainability before a recession. It also signals  that they're making decisions for their bottom line, rather than a run  at winning another season in NA or making a worlds run.

\- unbalanced teams (Everyone on the enemy team is so much better than everyone on my team, including myself)

\- Smurfs. I feel like every other game I am fighting smurfs

\- Toxicity. Team mates inting because they are tilted or leaving the game is so common its a joke. And it always happens to me because the other team is always so much better than mine

\- I'm Bronze 4. Why the hell am I in games with silver and gold players? Why am I not playing people who are the same skill level as me? It makes it impossible to move up and makes me just not want to play ranked at all.

\- The overuse of meta champions such as Miss Fortune, Ekko, Master Yi, Garen, Darius, Yasuo, Morgana. All of who are so broken and overplayed and not nerfed enough to be able to fight them in low elo.

I guess my biggest complaint is being put in games and lobbies where they other team is all Silver 2, Mastery level 7, whereas my team is all bronze with one silver and maybe two Mastery level 5 champs.

715,leagueoflegends,"That is, similar to Mortal and Dominik's, make one have AP, Grievous Wounds, and less Pen, while the other has just AP and higher Pen.

I'd even go so far as to make a Last Whisper counterpart that takes two amp tomes to make one item with 20% magic penetration. Maybe call it Final Word.

**Void staff**

* Built from Final Word and Blasting Wand
* Grants 35% magic pen and 80 AP
* (lower pen to account for the %pen available earlier w/ FW, but higher AP to account for the higher combine cost required to get the costs of Void and Morello to match)

**Morellonomicon**

* Built from Final Word and Oblivion Orb
* Grants only 25% magic pen, the same 80 AP, and the Grievous Wounds passive.
* No longer grants HP
* Oblivion Orb would become the Executioner's equivalent, removing the ruby crystal from its build path and replacing the flat penetration with Grievous Wounds

This would solve the complaints about having to spend 3000g just to get the GW that's readily available to other classes despite the fact they apply it more easily, as well as the issue of mages just rushing as much flat pen as possible.

^(It'd also have the fringe benefit of offering an alternative to Bramble Vest to AP engagers like Amumu and Zac.)",Void and Morello should get the Last Whisper treatment

767,leagueoflegends,"So with Riot confirming that there will be 120 ish skins this year- especially for the poor champions that haven't gotten one in a while (looking at you, Ornn)- its time for some theories (read: educated guesses) about what they will be.

Now Riot's been a fan of their annual skin events: we've had this year's Dark Star already (sadly, it did not include Aatrox, Pantheon, Ornn, Volibear, or Fiddlesticks- maybe next year...), Dragonslayer, and the Coven skins. A bunch of smaller skinlines- Worldbreaker, the DnD line, and Guardian of the Sands got new editions. We also got Blackfrost and Mecha Kingdoms, which will hopefully return since they look really good, and apparently Night and Dawn are expanding to include champions that aren't toxic.

So what haven't we had? Star Guardian, High Noon, and Project are the big ones. There's also Arcade, Elderwood, which I'm pretty sure will include Ornn, and possibly Battle Academia. There could be another music skinline too, which I'm pretty excited about.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's look at the champions that are confirmed to be getting a skin: Pantheon, Bard, Skarner, Mordekaiser, Rek’Sai, Xerath, Kindred, Ornn, Karthus, Vel’Koz, Sion, Twitch, Taric, Nautilus, Trundle, and Taliyah.

Pantheon would have done best as a cosmic skin (I'm pretty sure most of us have seen the Cosmic Spear Pantheon vs Abyssal Star Aatrox fanart), but he could fit into Project or Arcade.

Bard is Bard and might end up anywhere, just like ingame, although Star Guardian would be fantastic and amazing and beautiful.

Skarner needs to be playable first. That said, he's got a skin in the Project universe already, so that's ruled out.

Morde's got his shiny new Dark Star that I can't get because I'm too quarantined to buy gift cards :(.

Same for Xerath.

Rek'Sai's gotten her Blackfrost, which looks great.

I have no idea where Kindred goes. Project, with Wolf as some evil death drone? Star Guardian? Some new, previously unheard of skin line? Its a mystery/

We know about Ornn.

Not sure about Sion and Karthus. A Pentakill remake, maybe?

I personally cannot believe Vel'Koz didn't get a Dark Star. Maybe he'll get a battle boss, who knows?

Twitch, Taric, Nautilus, and Trundle have gotten their skins too, so now we have Taliyah.

&amp;#x200B;

The total amount of skin lines tailored for wholesome teenage girls is quite limited- I don't see her in the Project universe, and she'll make an iffy arcade at best. IMO she'll probably be a Star Guardian or the hypothetical return of Battle Academia featuring Riven and Taliyah (I can totally see Yasuo as their grumpy teacher hahah). I saw an animated Battle Academia Taliyah floating around on this subreddit a while ago, it was really good.

And finally, another plead to Riot to give us Kandy Kayn. We got Star Guardian Urgot for gods sake. Riot please.

This may affect Lucian more than Yuumi since he is an adc and needs to auto attack, but I just thought it doesn't make that much sense. Would it really be that op if she could do this? It can fuck you over at times - you ult, but the person you were chasing has flashed/dashed/run out of range of the root (the hitbox is deceiving sometimes) and you want to Q instead to slow him, which you can't do during your ult duration. Also in a close botlane fight you would need to do this to get that bit of damage off that may win the fight with autos and q's. Mainly early of course.

Would it be that substantial of a buff if Yuumi got the ability to cancel Final Chapter early? Would it be op? If riot were to let her do this, should they add limitations?

805,leagueoflegends,"While everyone is talking about Effort and Cuzz overperforming and leading T1 winning in such an easy fashion, I believe Doran's underperformance was the real reason SKT won in such a fashion. 

T1 may be strong or strongest in LCK right now but they took loses from HLE, Freecs, KT and Damwon - all of which are way weaker than them. This just shows that T1 isn't unbeatable as it seems, with proper drafting, macro, and rotation, any team can beat T1; that's what I thought before this match. But what I noticed with Drx vs T1 is that mechanics and drafting alone can't really overcome the great wall which is T1. To overcome T1 you have to have the grit, and patience. 

I believe Grit - as in doing well under great pressure, is what Doran lacking the most right now as we saw him getting first blood 2x in super easy fashion which seems so unlikely of him. Patience is also most likely the main reason the Drx lost the game. 2x they rushed Baron even they knew T1 Tps were up and both times not only they lost in clash, but lost Baron as well. 

There are a lot of scenarios showed how impatient Drx was but what really caught my attention is that a lot of times T1 could have pushed inhibitors in game 1 and 2 with minimal risk, yet T1 didn't do so and decided with 100% risk free push in different sidelanes, taking Drx resouces and map vision control, and winning the game step by step without pressure. Which brings me to my point that to win against a very patient T1, you have to be patient as well, just like what Drx did in game 3 which they won against T1 in easy manner as well.

I play top and supp mostly when I play Top mundo I carry or win my lane in at least 75% of games but how come in every game is 2 laners who are 2/15? I just dont understand why am I with these people in games I can carry 2 people but I just cant carry 3 or 4 people. I am tank most games I have most wards objectives turret destroyed I solo at least 1 herald at the end of game my damage is usualy 15 or 20 k higher than adc or midlane what is wrong? I am even telling jng to focus on mid bot and not to gank me but still... When I play top it is usualy very bad on botlane...  When I play supp I have warding score around 70at the end of game with apx 6 to 8 control wards most of the time I have to carry my adc as they just cant play defensively and dont know when trade... In arpund 60% of games I again have more dmg than my adc what the hell is wrong?

I dunno but I would expect I will be paired with aproximately same skilled people like last season and I am fine.

Is it that most old players left and only new players playing now?

Or is it that so many people are smurfing on both sides that the team skill difference is so huge?

820,leagueoflegends,"It's something I noticed for a while specifically with Yasuo's Q, where Jax's counter-strike does allow Jax to dodge a Yasuo Q, but Teemo blind does not do anything to Yasuo's Q. It's an interaction that I've questioned for a while on whether or not it was done on purpose or is a small over-looked detail, but in my honest opinion I believe that Teemo's blind CC and Jax's counter-strike ability should work essentially the same way in terms of interactions. At first I chalked it down to just difference in the 'small print' of the abilities, but today I decided to go and see the abilities for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is Yasuo's Q ability description as per leagueoflegends fandom's page about him:

""Yasuo thrusts his sword in the target direction, dealing physical damage to enemies hit and applying **on-hit** and **on-attack** effects to the first enemy hit.""

Here is Yasuo's Q ability description as per the official leagueoflegends website:

"" Steel Tempest is treated as a basic attack and scales with all the same things. ""

This means that:

1. Yasuo's Q ability is treated as a basic attack
2. Yasuo's Q ability can also trigger on-hit effects such as BoRK, Sheen, and Wit's End etc

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here's a description of what the CC 'Blind' (applied by Teemo Q) does according to the leagueoflegends fandom page (I could not find any official leagueoflegends website that described it):

""Unit that is blinded will **""Miss"" their basic attacks**, **similar to when attacking a target with dodge**. Missed attacks will fail to deal damage or apply on-hit effects, with the exception of some empowered attacks.""

This means that:

1. Any blinded unit will 'miss' their basic attacks (can't hit anything with auto attacks for the duration of the blind)
2. Theoretically, because Yasuo's Q is treated as a basic attack directly quoted from the official League of Legend's website description of his ability, his Q should NOT be able to hit anything when blinded.
3. I am unsure what the latter part of 'with the exception of some empowered attacks', but I don't believe Yasuo's Q ability falls within the rage of empowered attacks, so I will believe it doesn't matter in this scenario. Hopefully this doesn't come to bite me later.

Also note that the description of blind clearly even states that the blind cc is '**similar to when attacking a target with dodge'*****.*** Which is a clear comparison of Jax's counterstrike dodge with the blind cc.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, here's a description of what Jax's counter-strike ability does as per the leagueoflegends fandom page:

""Jax enters Evasion, a defensive stance, for 2 seconds, causing all **non-Turret basic attacks against him to be dodged**.""

Here's the description of Jax's counter-strike ability as per the official leagueoflegends website:

""Jax's combat prowess allows him to dodge all incoming attacks for a short duration and then quickly counterattack, stunning all surrounding enemies.""

The official League of Legends page is pretty detail-lacking in terms of what Jax's counter-strike actually dodges, as they say 'all incoming attacks', which is clearly not true in terms of abilities, so I'll go off of the leagueoflegends fandom page.

This means that:

1. Jax's counter-strike ability enables him to enter Evasion, which allows him to dodge all 'non-turret basic attacks'. This encompasses normal basic attacks.

&amp;#x200B;

So, after looking into both Teemo's Blind CC and Jax's Evasion, on paper it seems that both would completely nullify basic attacks, which includes Yasuo's Q according to the official League of Legends website. **However**, Yasuo's Q is **NOT affected** by Teemo's Blind. Yasuo can still use his Q to attack Teemo even through a blind, even though Teemo's blind is supposed to make people 'miss' their basic attacks, and Yasuo's Q is treated as a basic attack, which is why Jax's **evasion** allows him to dodge Yasuo's Q. 

Now, I'm not sure if this has been addressed before and I'm just digging up some interaction that everyone already knows about, but I just wanted to bring it to light in case this is not how the interactions are intended to be played out.

In my opinion, Teemo's blind CC and Jax's evasion should blind/evade the exact same things, and have the exact same interactions across all abilities and attacks. They're both supposed to nullify basic attacks and on-hits, but apparently have some contrasting differences on what they actually do. 

Of course, if this is 'working as intended', then I believe either the blind CC or Jax's counter-strike ability should have their descriptions changed to better detail what they respectively do. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: teemo blind doesnt block yasuo q but jax e blocks yasuo q :confused:",Why do Teemo's blind and Jax's counter-strike ability (E) not have the same block interactions?
821,leagueoflegends,"Hey there, I just wanted to start off by saying that I don't know how Reddit works, but I wanted to share my thoughts on Aatrox. 

I started maining him right after the rework, and man have I loved this champion. I know people say he is nothing like old Aatrox, but that aside, I love this new champion. I have always played tanky champions that deal damage. He has everything I have ever wanted in a top laner, from mobility to cc, and everything in between, he has it all. 

But I feel like he has one major problem that could be improved with one quality of life buff. While he has excellent set up for his q's with his w, I know from experience that that never seems to be enough for him to hit his crit spots later in the game. Sure he can use his e to reposition them, but it's all still very telegraphed, and easily dodge-able. 

I think that making his q animations speed scale with attack speed will be a healthy way for him to gain more consistency for landing his q crits, but even more importantly it will make it so people may be able to build him like he was old Aatrox, which I think all would welcome. I don't want him to be overpowered, but I do think that he could use this quality of life update in order to make him more in line to old Aatrox. 

So for some reasons why I think this would work;

1. It would have little to no impact on his early game. This buff would be aimed more towards later game impact, and seeing as how current Aatrox scales weird, I think this would help him out (I'm in no way saying he's bad late game, just that this would help him in a very healthy way)
2. Current Aatrox is supposed to be a drain tank, and with the removal of his revive, this is his most important distinction between the likes of other juggernauts like garen, who does have hp gain, but not IN combat. The most limiting factor to Aatrox's identity of being a drain tank is how long the animation of his q is, being since it's his main damage source, it needs to play out its full animation before gaining back hp. With that being sped up (if one builds so accordingly,) it will help cement this identity. 
3. There are some great items that give attack speed that normally Aatrox would ignore. With the rise in stregnth of blade of the ruined king for melee users, I would love to see it have an effective slot in Aatrox's inventory, but I don't think its necessarily worth it without the q animation being scaled with attack speed. Another amazing item would be wit's end, which is a great item and fits very well within the drain tank play style they are trying to go for, but ultimately has absolutely no synergy with how his current q operates, not even offering damage for the ability to scale off of. 

Obviously, some tuning would be needed to get this  just right. I in no way want this buff to be overpowered, I just mainly want Aatrox to have a more viable build path, while opening up the nostalgic old builds from the previous Aatrox. I want feedback on this please, and if anyone has any other counter ideas to make current Aatrox more in line with old, I would love to hear them.

Thank you for reading! :D","Aatrox needs his q animation speed to scale with attack speed, and, in my humble opinion, here's why:"

857,leagueoflegends,"It's pretty normal for Mid mains (like myself) to get 2-3 games in a row on a Secondary or Autofill position each session. But the lock down as significantly amplified the lack of Mid spots open. I am Regularly going 2-5 games in a row on my Secondary role or Auto fill just to get mid 1-3 times. What's the point of calling it your ""Primary"" role if I get it as frequently as Autofill? I have 3 accounts I have to dodge between where I regularly dodge 3 times in a row to get Mid and STILL get a different position. 

&gt; But OP back in the day we didn't have position ranked!

Yeah, I know. I was also one of the 2 people that played exclusively Team Builder until it was removed. But those were different times. The Romans used to use led pipes. Does that mean we should settle for led because Home Depot don't have copper? No. A new norm was created with role selection, it should either be upheld or removed for something better. 

&gt; But OP, I play AD and *ALWAYS* get *my* role.

Yes, I too get your role very often, that's the problem. 

&gt; But OP, you should be just as good at Mid as you are EVERY role.

In a perfect world I'm sure everyone would love to be equally as skilled at every role; but again, no one is expected the play every role as per role selection. The vast majority of pros can't even play several roles. So right off the bat that expectation is overreaching and largely unfounded. Most people dodged if they didn't get their role before role selection, so even back then this point makes no sense.

&gt; But OP queue times will go through the sky if you guys get your role more than half the time!!!

Has Riot EVER released any data showing this to be significantly true? Odds are 95%+ of the people spouting this talking point over and over without thinking wouldn't notice a change in queue time due to player pool to draw from. And the ~5% that would likely would prefer high quality games with more people playing their preferred role over a minute faster queue. But is that discussed? god no. Nothing like faster queue times 6 times in a row because someone dodged halfway though champ select over and over and over again. Now that's healthy gameplay!

---

Enough complaining, here is a reasonable solution I came up with in 3x the average Rioters work week (~5 minutes.).

Mark the Highest Priority Role at that give time. High Priority Roles have a cap of x Secondary or Autofill games in a row before they are immune to either for x more games. A ""High Priority Role"" is not exclusive to Mid, it could be any role at any give time in the day. Additionally it could be separated by elo but I'm sure that adds way more complicated than needed (bonus points?). That's it. It's like Autofill Protection but for whichever role is in the highest demand at the time. Incredibly complex and game breaking I know. 

Side note: Riot recently pulled back plans to punish dodging more due to community feedback. Imagine if instead of people having to dodge to get a high demand role, the other roles were more rewarding and ""fun"" to play. I know improving the game to balance out role selection is lunacy, but it's something to think about. 

**tl;dr** Mid mains have been getting screwed with Secondary / Autofill allocation for years now; but the lock down has made it considerably worse. The scales should be tipped at least slightly in our favor for once.",Secondary and Autofill needs to be balanced for Mid players not just the least popular roles.

900,leagueoflegends,"Every game I press tab and check who has healing to decide to buy anti healing or not, but almost every game nowadays have 3+ champs that heal a lot.

A big problem right now are the items, normal champions who don't heal very much normally buy items that heal a lot. I.e. wukong, normally doesn't heal, but he buys blade and death's dance and suddenly he lifesteals like a pre-rework sion ult. Champions in the meta right now abuse items that provide lifestea: blade, death's dance, ravenous hydra, gunblade, protobelt, GLP, sanguine's. 

The current anti-healing items feel very lackluster compared to what you can build that gives you lifesteal. An executioners costs 800g but only gives you +15 ad and is an inconvenience that takes up an item slot. For AP champs to get anti-healing you need to buy a full item of 3000g to get the effects. The only one that does not feel awful to buy is bramble vest, and that is only if you are on a tank and the enemy is heavily ad. The grevious wounds effect also only lasts for 3 seconds and cuts the healing by 40% which feels like it doesn't do anything at all most of the time.

Bonus rant as an ADC main: These bruisers just build items with damage and get healing and lifesteal anyways. As an adc, you heavily need the lifesteal to protect yourself from any sneeze from a mage or bruiser that put you on 25% hp. Problem is, most adc's can't build lifesteal until at least after 2 or 3 items. All they have is Legend: Bloodline, which needs time to stack. To rub salt in injury,  marksmen need to waste 800g and an item slot just to deal with 40% of the healing. And almost always you have to choose between either that or a qss, because getting both means a cannon minion deals more damage than you.",Healing and lifesteal are getting out of hand in league and the grevious wounds options are lackluster

[GG! 5 mIN tIlL ff. LeT'S OpEn1!](https://preview.redd.it/cing1t583gu41.png?width=314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90d3e68e6073b94adb5b08c374fa19f178425f4b)

But let's get real. I am an Azir lover.

And if you didn't know yet, Azir is a scaling champ. What really grinds my gears are player the following Wukong from one of my last games. Why? Well, let me explain.

First let me show you my team composition and the enemy one:

Our comp:

1. Kayle: Great Scaling, Peel, High DPS
2. Wukong: Great early- and midgame, even nice in lategame, engage + peel
3. Azir: Insane scaling, zoning control
4. Caitlyn: Good early and late game, zoning control
5. Thresh: Insane peel, engage/catches

Enemy comp:

1. Renekton: Great earlygame, later on a meatball if not ahead
2. Evelynn: Insane snowball  possibility, great to kill enemy carrys
3. Sylas: great scaling into midgame
4. Vayne: Insane scaling with 1v5  possibility
5. Soraka: Great to help Vayne survive the laning phase

Overall i would say both teams had a good team composition. And now the important thing, you should always think about: The winning conditions.

Our winning condition was to scale, maybe even get some catches and try to feed as little as possible. Sounds easy? Not in SoloQ. What happened was the following:

&amp;#x200B;

[Wukong died once and gave up. It was 0-1 and we were 5 min ingame.](https://preview.redd.it/2ky44zwe1gu41.png?width=364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b84b2e1813b782280e57ce49a770d15e7477cc7b)

But let me tell you, Soloq is super random. People like to tilt, some even RQ or get disconnected. And hellyeah I got great team member this time. No one got tilted by him. Everyone ignored him or muted him like me. We let him spam his surrender votes and scaled. And at the end? The enemy Vayne got caught, got flammed for it and rq. She was the only threat in lategame for us and we won that game after 29 min, just because we didn't give up.

So if you find yourself in a moment of tilt like that Wukong, please press tab and think about winning conditions. ^(But please leave League, if u tilt after First Blood)

913,leagueoflegends,"Over the past year, Rakan has been changed multiple times. In both patches 9.2 and 9.9, Rakan's kit was changed for the stated reason of lowering his competitive presence. These changes altered the feel of his kit significantly by slowing his W speed down and putting a casting time on his ultimate. So, did these changes truly lower Rakan's presence? Between the play ins and first half of the group stage at Worlds 2019, Rakan is currently at a 62% presence, which is undeniably high. Was the added clunkiness to Rakan's kit worth his small decrease in presence? If only there was a way to have kept the fun, fluid feel of Rakan's kit without having him be overpowered in competitive. Well, before the patch 8.6 buffs, Rakan was perfectly balanced in competitive play &amp; solo queue. In patch 8.6, Rakan received buffs to his E range and Q AP ratio. After these changes, Rakan became widely popular in the competitive scene. Before patch 8.6, though, Rakan was only ever picked with Xayah due to his E range making his engages more risky when not with Xayah. Take the 2018 spring split (which occurred before patch 8.6) as an example. In the LCK, LPL, NA LCS, &amp; EU LCS, Rakan had under a 35% presence in every major region throughout the whole split. 

https://lol.gamepedia.com/EU\_LCS/2018\_Season/Spring\_Season/Champion\_Statistics https://lol.gamepedia.com/NA\_LCS/2018\_Season/Spring\_Season/Champion\_Statistics https://lol.gamepedia.com/LPL/2018\_Season/Spring\_Season/Champion\_Statistics https://lol.gamepedia.com/LCK/2018\_Season/Spring\_Season/Champion\_Statistics 

As you can see, Rakan was not the pro play menace he currently is, even with his old RW engage. Rakan is particularly popular right now in season 10 in the LEC, where he resides at a 65% presence throughout the regular split. 

Conclusion: So, I, alongside many other Rakan players, find that the current changes (casting time) have made Rakan overall less fluid &amp; fun. The casting time has taken away some of Rakan's playmaking potential significantly. Since Rakan's pickrate in competitive is still somewhat high (as of season 10), future nerfs / changes are not out of the question. I feel the best course of action would be to revert Rakan to his pre patch 8.6 state (before the E range buffs). Before patch 8.6, Rakan had a decent winrate in solo queue, a moderately low competitive presence, and had his old, fun kit (the old RW combo). Like what was done with Rengar and Leblanc in the past, Rakan should be reverted back to the days when his kit was not altered by nerfs and his competitive pick rate was lower than it is now.",Rakan Ultimate Casting Time

950,leagueoflegends,"Recently someone pointed out that his theme didn't really match his gameplay. So I can with a sort of mini-rework that might be able to address this:

* Slight change to Q fear passive: 
   * Enemies are now feared when an enemy champion is isolated rather than you are unseen. This has a static cooldown after use of an ability.
* The second change to his Q passive. Now you are unseen or stand still for a while ones you move towards an enemy champion when he's within a specific range you will move on 4 legs similar to the trailer: [https://youtu.be/jNn2F39G-6s?t=60](https://youtu.be/jNn2F39G-6s?t=60). In this state you will have the following effects:
   * You gain enhanced movement speed while walking towards enemy champions
   * You will be able to ult but without the channel and the blink but ult will no longer apply fear.
* His ult now always fears unless in the hunt state from the previous point.  
* For his passive, enemies now are feared briefly (let's say 0.5 to 1 seconds) when destroying an effigy, this will happen 1 second after effigy is destroyed. If fiddle is nearby he automatically goes into the hunt state when he's within range while the enemy is feared from the effigy.

This could help his early ganks a bit as well making effigies more dangerous. If the enemy is tricked and attacks the edgy he gets that brief fear and people will be in terror because they think fiddle is nearby and can kill them now.",Idea for fiddle on how to make him match his theme

958,leagueoflegends,"Basically, I haven't been playing much lately, a few occasional games with friends. Lately, I've been having no fun at the game because without fail I'll always be playing against much stronger opponents in Normals.

I'm level 98 Unranked and I've always been in the Bronze zone when ranked. I'm now finding myself in lanes against Platinum players all the time. I figured hey, maybe it's because of my higher (Gold) ranked friends have a high Normals MMR, so I jumped into a game by myself. No, turns out I'm the one with the ridiculous MMR as I get placed in a game littered with Platinum and Gold players.

Not only do I obviously lose lane hard, but I also now have to listen to a three-man premade flame me all game for how bad I am, and finally tell me I must be schizophrenic after the match because apparently I was just imagining everything they wrote in chat.

My friend has now told me to get myself ranked as that apparently will balance my Normals MMR somehow but I think he's making that up to keep me from quitting the game permanently.

Now my question to you - is there anything I can do to get my MMR back to levels where it should be given my level of skill? Of course that is apart from letting every team abuse me for feeding for the next year which might not even work if I keep getting carried.

I should add that I didn't have a high winrate together with my friends either that would have pulled my MMR up by a few thousand points.

Check out my match history:  [https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=EverSnaxolotl](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=EverSnaxolotl)

We went on a custom game and I Q'ed him at 9 lvl with just a longsword and he had one minor armor rune (as a talon). My Q did 153 dmg.   
After that I bought Youmuu's Ghostblade. My Q then did 196 dmg. Then he bought Ninja tabi and my Q did 160.  
So basically his 1100 gold item mitigated almost entirely a 2900 item. And I know you gonna say that he bought something tanky so he lacks damage.   
In this particular situation Talon could 100-0 with his full combo, and i was 200 hp short if I managed to hit triple Q.  
This isnt a Zed rant I assume all of AD assassins suffer the same when someone rushes Ninja tabi. And now imagine that Seeker's Armguard costs the same as Ninja tabi has 10 more armor, gives ap (so it helps mages with some dmg) and builds into one of the most powerful items in the game.

987,leagueoflegends,"This is not a post about non-optimal matchmaking. I am posting because I am absolutely mind blown.

I just played a game in Platinum that started with the midlaner, Katarina, asking ""Why am I in a platinum game again?"". I asked what her rank is, Silver 3. So naturally i thought she had an insane winrate, and went on with the game. Her skills didn't match up with my expectations for a silver player, and we ended up losing the game. After the game I wanted to dive a bit deeper, and searched for her name on op.gg.

What i found was sad. It was sad for her teammates, and even more sad for her. She was not a silver player with an unusually high winrate. She was not a former high-ranked player playing her provisionals. She was not even a hardstuck silver player that happened to slip into a platinum game once.

Level 39. First account. New account. First provisionals played on that account. Horrible stats in every game. 0.5:1 KDA average. 2-3 CS per minute average.

And every single one of her ranked games have a tier average of high gold or low platinum.

I know Riot gets hate for their matchmaking all the time. But this is the first time I have seen something this severe. This is as i said very sad for her teammates. But even more, a lot more sad for her. Her ranked experience has been rough.

I don´t mind to be matched against smurfs from time to time, it´s a challenging Game and being able to win it sometimes is even more fun. But if I play ranked I want to have a chance to actually win the game. I got quite a good win streak in the past weeks, due to me playing at least 3 rankeds a day and me improving my overall gameplay and my mindset going in those games. But running into three smurf duos in the past 6 Games is a really frustrating experience. Especially this game is one that stands out to me. I don´t get how the system thinks that it would be a good idea to match ppl with a winrate below 40% against ppl having a winrate above 80% and higher. That just feels like you don´t even get a chance to win. How are those with the sub 40% winrate even supposed to beat the smurfing duo? Matching duos against duos is fine for me, but if I see things like this happening I think there need to be more factors to determine Matchmaking to get a somewhat fair Experience for everyone.

Once i logged in the game constantly asked me to reconnect, I clicked on reconnect it came up with an error and didn't connect to a game. Also at this point, my friend's list was gone. So I thought that this was an issue with Riot as they've stated there's a lot of issues in League currently. So I switched to my smurf account Level 16 or so and played 1 game. After that game I noticed that my friend's list was there and ranked was able to be played, however, the account being level 16 was the issue and not the game, if that makes sense.

I instantly re-installed league and after the re-install, I actually saw more than just a reconnect button (obviously the hacker had finished his game). There was also a friend request from a level 7 account that I later followed up on. I then was logged out due to being logged into another location, at this point I knew my account was hacked. So I instantly changed my League password and looked at my match history to confirm that I was indeed hacked.

After I secured my account I created a support ticket to which I'm still waiting to hear back from, the hacker didn't try log back into my account and couldn't completely steal my account, because my passwords for games/email accounts are completely different (so if one was compromised they can't get the other).

After I secured my account and made a ticket I didn't think too much about it, you wouldn't right? Its a waiting process for Riot to contact you and then try to recover the changes they've made in my account (Tokens, in collection spending points/combining my skins, feels bad man).

So I think re-added some of my friends later that night and we played League. The following day I got an email from Riot saying I was banned for cheating, I honestly didn't even consider the fact that the person who stole my account would also cheat.. I've made a support ticket and hopefully, they will come back to me, but now I'm concerned about the overall damage to my account..

This account has been created in 2012 or earlier, I honestly can't remember. It's an eye opener to what people can do. For anybody who think's it might've been me who cheated, I'm pretty certain that Riot can see a change in IP addresses (hopefully). I've invested time/money into this account and I hope that the support from Riot can prove that I'm innocent.",Hacked and banned :(

Of each loot box, there are three main designs (ie. pengu, mole and sentinel).  

However, there is also 8 minor colour variations of each main designs and two upgrades for each colour variant.  The loot box can award these in any order.

Say you desired any Pengu Little Legend but your RNG was particularly bad, you could get the other two designs, their 8 colour variants and each of their respective upgrades.  In total, you would have purchased 54 of the loot boxes in total, at 490RP each (roughly equating to $AUD 5).

Only on your 55TH would that design be a certainty.

TLDR: The TFT Little Legends loot boxes currently are EXTREMELY unfavourable if you desire a specific design.  Chances are very low and this whole design screams of corporate greed from Riot.  Possible minor false advertising as well, considering it does not draw much attention to the upgrades / colour variations on the loot box splash.","PSA for TFT: Do not buy the Little Legends loot boxes in their current state.

1021,leagueoflegends,"For the past few releases, League has missed the mark imo as far gimmick cohesive kits.  They love to focus on one gimmick and just let the rest of the kit be a mess long as that character does its gimmick. Sylas,Yuumi,Neeko, hell even Pyke and Kai'sa . Before I e explain why Quiyana is done right, let me explain what I mean about gimmicks vs cohesion.

For my example of cohesion I'll use Sylas vs Rubick as their gimmick is the same, yet there execution is vastly different. Both are spell stealers and while Sylas can only steal ultimates, this is not the biggest separation. Rubick in lore is the Grand Magus,a mage beyond all others. He is the definition of 'anything you can do, I can do better' His spells are all both simple yet effective with Q being a delayed CC with no damage and E being a targeted nuke that lowers attack damage.  His W buffs his outgoing spell damage and CC durations. These three skills are very generic, but allow all the emphasis to be on good stolen spells to make or break the best Rubick players. 


Sylas is a rebal, working from the seeds of Demacia's darkness to rise and lead an rebellion against the tyranny of the crown. Also he can use other people's magic I guess?  none of the rest of his moves really sink with that at all and are more in line with some kind of tank character. Q is more a ranged spam, W probably fits him the best as it suits his ""what's mine is yours"" nature, E just seems like a 'oh he uses chains and chains can grab people'. He just doesn't mesh as a spell stealer or some kind of rebel either.

Now what does this have to do with Quiyana? Well just look at her, everything she does meshes with her champ fantasy and gimmick. Everything synergizes with her Elements in some way, W and E both interact with Q. She may be the least hype release, but I think she shows signs of good things to come.",Quiyana is how to do a gimmick right

1024,leagueoflegends,"Let me first get this out of the way, item RNG right now does suck. I have had games going in to 1st round with a recurve bow against a guy with shojin + titanic pyke, it sucks, I get it. 

That being said, people have to stop complaining so much about for 2 simple reasons:

1 - This game mode has been in development for less than 3 months.

The initial play test group played on a build that had only been in development for 6 weeks, and about 2 weeks after that it hit PBE. A week after that it went up on live servers in a **BETA** state. That means that from start of development til now, the developers have had at best 3 months to work on it, and its not like all of Riot is in on this. From what Scarra has said, its a fairly small crew for this type of thing. 

That being said, they have other shit to work on. Just yesterday I had a bug where everyone playing had their champs disappear, never re-appear and the game couldn't even progress for all of us past round 2-2. Or how about a bug where one round it only showed me 4 champs not 5 and it wouldn't even let me buy any of them that round. That to me is a much bigger disadvantage than not getting 1 or 2 items. Which brings me to point number 2,

2 - Multiple streamers that got early access to TFT have said that Riot knows about the item issue and have said they are looking in to it. 

One of the first feedback they got was about the item RNG, especially in the first levels. Yea, it sucks, but I rather they fix **ACTUAL** game-breaking bugs like I mentioned above first.

Sure, if the item RNG still sucks in a month or two then yea, I understand how you (and I) can be pissed, but as it stands now I rather they devote their time and resources into improving the actual game stability and nerfing OP shit (I'm looking at you morello's Garen, thank god its being nerfed), rather than having a game where we all get about the same amount of items but a Lvl 3 Garen with Morello's literally 1v9 my whole team or me not being able to buy any champs for a whole round.",PSA to Those Complaining About Item RNG in TFT

Your store shows only 5(?) random champions at a time and you have to pay 2 gold to refresh the store. You can see what champions the other players are collecting by moving the mini map and the game tells you anytime a champion is combined.

  
What the store does not tell you; however, is how many total champions there are to begin with. It takes 9 Garens to get a Gold Garen. If there are only 10 Garens and I see someone else has a silver Garen, I know that I will never be able to get a gold one so I will stop collecting them.

1056,leagueoflegends,"Hi. There's almost two daily reddit posts here about things that TFT currently lacks, and specially posts about the RNG.

I feel like at this point we have reached the point of circle... is not jerking since they are genuine complaints and they have the reason, but yeah. People is just posting in circles.

So I wanted to put in a post the info we currently have about TFT upcoming features or current ones:

&amp;#x200B;

**- The RNG system:**

Yes. It's very unfair. Sometimes you get 4 items in the first minion rounds and sometimes you get nothing.

Yes, Dota Underlords did it more fair.  
The thing with this one is that they already adressed many times that they want to change it, to make the system more concise in terms of what number of items everyone gets, but leave the items in question still in RNG.  
We don't know when that system will come, I don't know if they want to have it ready to the ranked launch or for later.  


**- No Match history bug:**

In theory is not a bug, is just not done yet. IIRC this was kinda in a low priority in relations to other features that people want but still they wanted to have it for the next update. I don't know if the matches will show on the match history or will have their own tab.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Damage recap:**

They [already showed us the WIP of this one](https://twitter.com/RiotSapMagic/status/1142917096994512898), coming for either 9.14 or 9.15.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Skins on champions as you upgrade them:**

For the moment is a no.

The reason for this is that It would require A LOT of models to be loaded in the engine as well (3 per character) and this would have a huge impact on it's performance. The League engine is not prepared for that, and while they think that a High-end pc may be able to run it, more humble computers will not, and accesibility has always been the most important thing in League of Legends.

Seems like same, or similar thing would happen if they were to use chromas, but they are looking into ways of making each champion more unique and visually satisfying when you upgrade them. Personally I think the gold recover that you get on LVL3 looks very good in some champions (I love Lissandra), but it barelly appears in others.

They also talked about using skins in a future to introduce a variant of a champion, changing their class/origin and even their ability if it's fitting. Example, Draven (which currently has it's gladiator skin) which is imperial/blademaster, could be demon (or ghost?)/blademaster if they bring him with the Soulstealer skin.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Tutorial and more info In-launcher of how to play the game, Item recipes**

In a future. Right now they are relying on external things.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Option to show hexes:**

They are looking to put this since a lot of people would preffer this, but AFAIK there's no date yet, and It probably would be in a toggle option.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Colors on classes/origins, splash arts instead of models in the shop and more clarity on them:**

They are looking into the class/origins visual design, though they are kinda scared of how it would look to have a lot of colors on that.

Some people have complained about it using splash arts instead of models, but they are fine with it (And I'm as well, IMO it looks better and I don't have any problem identifying a champion.) what is needed is to slight highlight champions that you already have and heavy highlight champions that can be completed, as it happens in other Auto brawlers, and they said that they are also looking into this.

*That way Toast will stop missing it's level 3 draven, thx.*

&amp;#x200B;

**- No EXP after a match:**

Is not a bug either. It's intended: TFT will have it's own progression system.

In the PBE there is the Beta pass to unlock things (A free pet, map skins (that are basically chromas for the map), a free emote and Icons) through points that you get by completing missions. It has it's own tab in the client and should come next week for most servers. I think it's already on some since launch.

We don't know how the after-launch missions and progression will be, though. Missions probably will be the same, and they are currently like: ""Play 5 nobles"", ""Reach top 3 in at least x games"", ""Upgrade x Numbers of units to lvl3"".

&amp;#x200B;

**- Playing with Premades in Ranked:**

IIRC it will be 5 from gold and below, and as rank increases the number of possible premades will decrease.

They are wary with this since as people have mentioned, this system COULD be exploitable, but we have to see how it works first. If people find a way to exploit the system they said they will change it with no doubt.

Also, the rank system will not have promos. You just climb or fall, and the points you will get will depend as well of the people that you won or lost against. Higher reward if you won against someone with higher elo, lesser if lesser elo, like Summoner Rifts. Also remember that 1, 2 and 3rd place are considered wins, technically.

1082,leagueoflegends," 

I have been playing TFT for countless hours for the past couple weeks. I am in no way claiming to be a top 500 player, but I do feel I can offer some insight that may be beneficial. Overall, I find this game to be incredibly enjoyable and it has entirely consumed my free time. That being said, there are many pros and cons of this game-mode that I have opinions of. Yes, I am aware the game is still in beta, so please put away your pitchforks before reading and take what I have to say with a grain of salt. I’ll start with the cons first! As a disclaimer, any feature that is not currently in the game, does not qualify as a Con, I will go over my wants after my Pros section. Wishlist also included in the last section.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:**

* The single most frustrating thing in the entire game is when a piece gets stuck! Maybe I am positioning my Graves wrong or I put my Lucian in a poor spot, but I feel my champions get stuck way too often. For those who are not familiar with this occurrence… Basically what happens is when you hero goes to attack, they just stop moving. They do not complete their attack and they just stand around and refuse to move. This happens both when enemies are in attack range and remains even when enemies are out of range. This is a super frustrating occurrence and has both cost me games and won some for me. 
* Colorblind mode does not work. Even though it says I have it turned on, it doesn’t work. This may not be a huge deal for a large majority of the player base, but for me it sucks pretty bad. In the heat of a battle if my team has similar units to my opponent it is very hard to distinguish them from each other because everyone’s health bar is the same. 
* There is a chance that any unit’s attack will not do damage, if they gain enough mana to use their ability in the same frame they are attacking. This has happened to me plenty of times, and I have seen it happen to my opponents as well. If my Varus is auto attacking and he goes to charge up his ultimate ability, he will cancel his own attack and you will see the attack hit the enemy but it will do 0 damage. I just use Varus as an example, but this happens with plenty of other champions. I have noticed it very frequently with Varus, Ashe, Sejuani, Darius, Khazix, just to name a few. It is very frustrating when a battle is down to the wire and every attack is important.
* This con is not game-play related but I still find it kind of annoying. I cannot state this enough but… PENGU IS LOCKED BEHIND RNG. How are you gonna do me like that. If I want a certain 3-Star little Legend, the only way I can do that is by pumping out hundreds of dollars… On the PBE for example, the Pengu I wanted was the Ravenlord one. In order to get that guy to level 3 I used about $250 worth of RP. That’s pretty messed up if you ask me… Now I understand this is just for cosmetics, but this is a very EA move… I know the whales will still pay for something like this, but for the average player-base I feel like this is a slap in the face. I know new game modes don’t pay for themselves, but like come on…
* Often you will play the same enemy twice in a row. Nothing feels worse than getting absolutely dumpstered by the guy in 1st place and then having to play him again for a 2nd time immediately after. I am not talking about when you’re playing the “ghost” of someone, but the actual player. The same can be said when I am in first and I am against a guy I just beat, I feel bad for the poor soul that I kick out of the game, just because they had to face me twice in a row out of the 6 other players they could have faced. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros:**

* This is a breath of fresh air from Riot. Honestly, I was still really salty that Nexus Blitz was retired and had no chance of being a permanent game mode, but if had to sacrifice Nexus Blitz for this… Then hell yeah! I am happy to see new games being explored and I think this has been a great addition to the client. I love the being able to play a solo type game mode, but still have the opportunity to include my friends and have fun putting them in the dirt where they belong. No longer do I have to suffer through normal games with my silver friends flaming my ass for not carrying because “You’re the diamond, you should expect us to do bad so you have to carry”. This is a very relaxing game mode and I am completely in love with it.
* Leveling up a champion feels very impactful. I love the fact that when you level up a champion, it is very rewarding. When you take your Draven from lvl 1 to lvl 2 you can see the pop-off. I feel as though Tyler 1 himself is now my Draven and he has just finished slamming down his blood rush (discount code alpha). Jokes aside, not just Draven feels this way. Any time I level up a champion I know my team just got stronger. 
* There is plenty of diversity even though the champion pool is relatively low. At first, I was kind of disappointed how there was only a small fraction of the total available champions present in TFT. But after playing it, I realize how wrong I was. There is plenty of class and origin diversity that it creates a fun and exciting experience. There are so many different combinations you can cheese or experiment with, it is great!
* If you lose early, you’re free to move on to the next game! If I am playing poorly and getting destroyed, I will probably end in 8th place. When 8th place comes for me, I can just move on to the next game. I am not stuck in this game and forced to watch it out until the very end. I can simply move on and go the next game. It is absolutely fantastic. In summoner’s Rift if I am playing poorly and getting beaten, I am trapped in the game and forced to be as helpful as I can so my team can drag me to the finish-line. In this game mode I do not have to worry about that. If I do poorly, it is my own fault and I am free to move on to the next game.
* For the most part, abilities seem to be balanced. At first, I was very worried that champions like A-Sol would just completely dominate and ruin the game for players that weren’t able to get him. But they toned him down and he feels much better to play against. I feel champion’s ability are very balanced, while still having a large impact in fights. If my level 1 Sejuani manages to stay alive just long enough to get her ability off it’s a huge impact and it feels rewarding to see abilities pay off in such a manner. 
* Every item can be useful. This is something that is amazing, at least to me it is. Every item can be good and have a purpose. I have seen lots of posts where people are complaining that the item RNG is too bad and “my opponent got a rageblade at lvl 1 I auto lose WAAAAAH”. This is honestly not the case and I wish people realized it. Let me start by saying you don’t have to complete items as soon as you get the components… It’s ok to sit on components and put pieces on champions you know you’re going to discard later. You can gain temporary advantages in the early game while later on in the game combining your end game items. You can make almost any item work and the pay-off is huge. I love the diversity and creativity. 
* The release to live was relatively pain free! The long queue times were understandable, but there were no where as many problem as Crash ( I mean Clash….) Props to the release team and I look forward to the continued expansion of the TFT beta period.

&amp;#x200B;

**Wishlist:** \*disclaimer\* I am attempting to exclude anything Riot already said was coming or being worked on, such as damage recap.

* There is no easily available information in the client about this game mode or what the pieces do. Honestly this kind of bothers me. Riot is trying to introduce a new game mode and there is no information available in the client, no tutorial, no beginner tips, no class or hero information. I was kind of disappointed. The only way I learned how to play or what any of the pieces did was from watching streamers and much trial and error. In the beginning I didn’t even know Scarra had teamed up with Riot to put out those cheat sheets he made. Maybe have those linked somewhere? IDK just a thought. 
* There is no match history… Can we get this added? Is it already in the works or coming at a later time?
* I wish that we gained XP from playing TFT. Currently I am level 250, but I would like to be able to gain xp and level up from playing TFT. 
* Is there any honor feature coming to TFT? I wish there was a way to honor opponents or give out honor is some way. I would like to be able to finish out my honor level 5, but at this point I don’t want to go back to 5v5 or 3v3 game modes. 
* Can I please mute enemy Little Legend’s sounds??? Holy hell, whoever is spamming that dumb screeching noise on that griffin thing please let me mute them! Additionally, can we just mute players too? Some people type way too much. I really don’t care that you messed up and put your Garen in instead of your Lucian. I don’t need a play by play of your thought process. 
* It would be cool if we could use skins that we own for champions in TFT. I noticed for the most part all champions have their default skin except Vayne and Graves. Level 3 mecha kha’zix would be pretty sweet!

&amp;#x200B;

That is all I have for now. Thank you to those who took all the time to read this. Despite any cons I may have listed, I do really enjoy this game mode and I think it is absolutely fantastic. Good work to the team at Riot who put this together. It was totally worth the days spent leaving my computer on so I didn’t get logged out of the PBE. THANKS!","TFT: Likes, Dislikes &amp; Wishlist"

**A compendium of all things related to Riot's new game mode, Team Fight Tactics**

***

## Frequently Asked Questions:
     
**What is Team Fight Tactics?**     

&gt; Team Fight Tactics (TFT) is Riot’s version of the popular “Auto Chess” game ([Announcement](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/teamfight-tactics)). TFT is a round-based strategy game that pits you against seven opponents in a free-for-all race to build a powerful team that fights on your behalf. [Official Page](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/events/teamfight-tactics) &amp; [Official Gameplay Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liNLLx874g4).      

**How can I play?**     

&gt; TFT will be hitting live servers soon and can be [played in the League of Legends client](https://twitter.com/RiotSapMagic/status/1138148566784925697) once it does. Otherwise it can be played in the Public Beta Environment (PBE) server.     

**When will TFT be released on live servers?**     

&gt; Will be slowly rolled out in the [upcoming 9.13 Patch this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/c2z9dp/were_the_rioters_working_on_teamfight_tactics_ask/ernq7bi/). However, not all regions will be released at the same time, and will be rolled out in batches. [Current release schedule post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/hvzgE6om-tft-teamfight-tactics-release-timeline-and-temporary-restrictions).     

**Will TFT be a permanent mode?**     

&gt; Depends on its success. Quoting Riot SapMagic tweet, [""basically nothing is guaranteed to be permanent. For example: Let's say we release this and no one plays it or enjoys it. We probably wouldn't keep it around indefinitely.""](https://twitter.com/RiotSapMagic/status/1138108698314698752)        

**Will TFT be Free to Play?**     

&gt; TFT will be Free to Play, with no “Pay to Win”. There is [monetization through cosmetic skins](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/c2z9dp/were_the_rioters_working_on_teamfight_tactics_ask/ernppw6/) that can be bought through RP. These include [‘Little Legends’](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2019/06/dev-little-legends-in-teamfight-tactics/), Profile Icons, Arena Skins and a Battle Pass.     

**How can I play on PBE?**     

&gt; PBE requires a League of Legends account with a minimum of Honour Level 3. Account can then be registered on [LOL PBE Signup website](https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/pbe). Note, there is a [very large login queue](https://imgur.com/gallery/FHfaAAd) to play PBE at the moment.     

**When will Ranked TFT release?**     

&gt; [Ranked is planned to be released with LOL Patch 9.14](https://twitter.com/RiotMapleNectar/status/1142415070804074496). Patch 9.14 is scheduled for [July 17th](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018987893-League-of-Legends-patch-schedule).      

**Can I queue with friends in TFT and how will Ranked work?**     

&gt; For Normals, you'll be able to [queue with a full premade](https://twitter.com/RiotSapMagic/status/1138115048146997248). Ranked will be similar to how it works for Summoner's Rift (tiers, divisions, etc.), but won't have promotion series. [You'll be able to play with friends with up to 5 players for Gold and below and up to 3 players for Platinum and above.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/c2z9dp/were_the_rioters_working_on_teamfight_tactics_ask/ernoohw/)      

**Mobile or Cross-Platform?**     

&gt; [No plans yet](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/c2z9dp/were_the_rioters_working_on_teamfight_tactics_ask/ernp67t/), but mobile is definitely being looked at. They wish to focus primarily on PC first.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

we've got 1 obj

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 im reporting poppy

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

thats some massive troll

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 yeah 1v4

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

yoiu'll jump in

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

with no back up

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

nah

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 wahtever you say

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 not like riot can't see in game video

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

of you feeding

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

and you diving 1v5

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 i suggest muting

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

lets go next pls

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 just ff and report

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Post-Game

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

pls report poppy

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

trolled so hard

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As backup story. This poppy said in lobby ""i'm aggressive support"". so I picked draven. at lvl 2, i noticed i was solo.  thought ok this guy is just roaming. i solo'd bot lane until I was lvl 8/9. he was ""ganking"" other lanes but stayed lvl 4. he'd jump in 1v5 and dies. says ""i was doing my job, not sure about you guys"" but somehow that's not trolling?

&amp;#x200B;

so is toxicity something riot deems as even close to verbal? I mean I get when I say stuff like ""fuck you, you're an inbred piece of shit whoshould uninstall the game"" but literally describing as things go play by play is offensive now?  


Should I just /mute all moment I get in game to prevent this?",So someone explain to me how this is toxic. Returning player just confused on what the criteria is nowadays.
1170,leagueoflegends,"Of course im talking about the new League of Legends twitch prime bundle, i got that and i still havent after 20 minutes gotten that. I cannot see any ""delay warning"" anywhere. Thank you for the help.",How long does it take for Twitch Prime stuff to come?
1171,leagueoflegends,"So I've bought both LEC (G2) and LCS (TL) team passes. There's no week that at least one game doesn't count and I have to rewatch the VOD (and even then, sometimes the first VOD won't count and I have to rerun it). Additionally, first TL game and second G2 game of the split still didn't count for me, even though I've rerun the VODs like tens of times during last weeks. And now, apparently RR games don't count too.

While half of the benefits is supporting your favourite teams, the second half is the rewards, and because of how buggy it is I'm not sure if I'll even be able to claim the chroma.

1174,leagueoflegends,"A certain player on EUW, who does not go by the name FRICIS, is constantly queuing up and leaving games so that his team remakes them. Why? I don't know, but since he (not FRICIS) doesn't lose MMR by doing this (only lp), one can only speculate. Perhaps this player wants to play in high MMR with a low rank? Hmm, really makes you wonder. I wonder what FRICIS (just some solo queue jungler I like) thinks about this. Always does it as Sejuani as well (FRICIS' most played is Lee Sin so it's not him). It'd be cool if Riot took a look at this person, but not FRICIS (FRICIS is innocent), since Riot support won't :)

But I’m not having the same success anymore, despite being better at the game overall nowadays.

1188,leagueoflegends,"Okay, so I ended last season in gold, and was again placed in silver this season.  


I climbed to gold, then took a break for a few months. The past week I've started playing again, and I'm already Plat 4. I'm getting +29/-12 every game, and playing against Plat1/Dia4 players. Makes absolutely no sense, because I am simply not that good.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the reason for this is that the first 7/8 games I've played I was quite lucky and had solid teams. These wins didn't properly reflect my skill, and now I seem to be snowballing into Plat 1.   


Enter the last game I played, where for once I was *not* the one feeding. Instead, the jungle fed my Riven when I wasn't there, and midlane ended the game inting because we ""stole"" his farm when we were pushing the lane after a tf.  


I did a little investigation. The Kayn was a Plat 1 player, nothing new, except he's lvl 39, and unranked last season. Okay, sure, smurf you might think, but he'd only played 25 games. 25. 25 games is enough for Riot's system to decide that a relatively fresh account belongs in Plat 1 (where it clearly didn't).  


It is now that I realize that maybe I'm not as good as I thought I am. If this Kayn was able to reach Plat 1 after only 25 games, I think I too am getting some absurdly preferential treatment from the ranked system. Something is seriously janky after the changes, in my opinion.",Climbing is too closely tied into luck. From a Gold player who's in Plat

Is a jungler who's unique passive is that he builds up extra EXP when alone, and in the jungle (can get maybe 2 levels ahead from just farming).  The catch is that he/she loses EXP when in lane, and team fighting, and can actually lose levels which would revert the ability point he/she most previously leveled.

They might have to tweak how much is gained or lost, because later on in the game, being alone in the jungle probably isn't a great idea, but i think they could design the champ to ramp in a strong mid game, but fall off into late game.",Healthy or Horrible: Reverse Laning Champ

I enjoyed playing Jungle Pyke. I loved farming until level 6, ganking bot lane for (hopefully) double kills, and trying oh so hard for that sweet sweet pentakill ult music. You know what has been completely and utterly gutted by Riot’s “her der he’s not in his specifically assigned role” policy?

Jungle Pyke. Literally I can’t even kill raptors now because I can’t proc Hunters Talisman on them with his Q and E.

1208,leagueoflegends,,Europe Obliterates North America | Rift Rivals 2019 Day 1 Recap
1209,leagueoflegends,"As a standalone game mode, this is hands down the best alternative Riot has put out compared to the main game. Just about the only similarities to the main game are the IPs (champs, items, etc). I understand it is still in ""beta"" phase, but there are some things that could be done to tune the consistency.

1. Flat Item Drops per Minion Wave

Oh god, especially in the initial phases of the game, it feels SO good to get one or two complete items before PvP starts. You can essentially build your squad around the items dropped, but you know what feels *awful*?

Getting no items at all then playing against two people with completed items.

My solution would be to have no items drop on the first wave, exactly one item drop second wave, then one GUARANTEED item third wave with a CHANCE for exactly a second. This way, everyone starts on the same playing field with a couple lucky players getting a chance at having a second item completed. In conjunction with champs offered, this may or may not be a big enough advantage.

2. Flat Champ Upgrade on Wave Three

This is less impactful but still a step towards consistency. Allowing players to decide whether they want to add an extra champ or two to their roster or get a guaranteed upgrade on their starting champ would give players the opportunity to decide if their starting item or starting champ is more valuable. 

3. Matchup Consistency

You know what feels worse than being 6th or 7th place and getting absolutely smashed by the top seat? Getting smashed by top seat twice in a row.

There is something that could be done with matchmaking to make this less painful.


Overall, I really enjoy this game. It's enthralling and delightful, but with a couple tweaks, it would have a much more satisfying feeling of accomplishment or a satisfying feeling of defeat","TFT has been out a couple days now, and I am already addicted. Boy, are there some things I'd change though."

1226,leagueoflegends,"Okay this is gonna be a long one but I just had to get this off my chest.

So I jumped onto the Auto-Chess bandwagen about two months ago. I played DAC for about two weeks (until the massive disconnects mid-game started happening). It was hard to get into, not gonna lie, but with a little bit of help and a good portion of trial and error, it got easier. Probably the worst part of the experiencing here was the dota client, finding a lobby and the toxic community.

&amp;#x200B;

I then started playing the mobile Auto-Chess version, which is extremely forgiving, has a pretty clean UI and lots of information about everything, from items over pieces and what everyone does to racial/class buffs, both during a game (for a quick read up) and when in the main menu screen (with detailed informations and everything).

&amp;#x200B;

With the open beta release of Underlords I started playing that as well and it's fantastic. A friend of mine picked up the game and got the hang of it within less than 5 games - with only a brief explanation from me prior. The UI is amazing, at any point in the game you can find out pretty much every information, you can play tutorials or multiplayer or against bots, the item system is pretty cool. Sure, it's lacking in terms of Profile, personal stats and the like, but the gameplay itself is really nice already.

&amp;#x200B;

And now TFT is out and it feels... not polished at all. I know, I know, it's still in some kind of testing phase. But it's so poorly integrated into League of Legends, it might just as well be ""just an idea"". Here's the major issues I have with it right now.

&amp;#x200B;

* There is no information about anything anywhere. The only thing you get is the TFT Gameplay Guide, which currently sits in the second row of the News tab on the Home screen. And even that guide is pretty lackluster in my opinion.
* The games do not show up in your match history. Fine.
* Class/Origins are only explained in the game - and even then only the classes you have pieces of. 
* The champions itself could use a little explanation too, since they don't really work like they do in the actual game. 
* The game instantly puts you into the first carousel draft, which in itself is a neat idea, but for someone new to this, it's just a giant ""what is happening"" moment. 
* Seriously what is with the ""mystery"" spatula shit? I like the effect, but please a little more transparency would be nice.
* The item system is pretty bad. Considering there is no list of possible item combinations, neither in the game itself nor in the client, and the effects are not necessarily the same as in the actual game, it's very poorly designed.
* The timing is off. It feels like there is very little time to actually ""play"" (as in manage your pieces and items) compared to the other games. Since I have to read up on everything as I go (who has which origin/class, what's their ability, what happens when I combine these items, oh right positioning, wait how much XP do I have? etc etc) time runs out super quickly.

And before you start calling me a noob, yes, some of this will become obvious with more practice, especially the class/origin/item thing. But is it so difficult to put the Gameplay Guide in the actual client? And a broken down version into the game menu? Make the important things a little more visible? Some chinese dota players managed to build a better, more inviting and more readable game interface than Riot Games.  


I honestly have to wonder what feedback the PBE phase of the gamemode had. The mechanics itself seem to work, sure. The little legends are obviously polished from top to bottom (cuz they bring the money right). But the UI and information delivery is severely lacking.

1235,leagueoflegends,I'm waiting..........,When is TFT coming to the korean server...?
1236,leagueoflegends,"And what I mean is that TFT can easily be ported over to mobile devices/tablets. This does sound crazy but it potentially could be a great idea. My idea sprung up while I was home streaming the client through steam (added league as a non steam game) onto my phone (LG v30+) over a 5Ghz wifi. And to my surprise it worked really good. The visuals of the game was fantastic and even dragging the champs felt natural, just like on a PC. Albeit with the shared draft round, it was annoying as hell to pick the right champ &amp; item double tapping the screen and moving my legend. But it was great fun, it felt like I could be anywhere around the house and not need to be Infront of my PC to play. And games don't even take that long to play out, it's around 15-25min. After 2 games (got 4th and 3rd placed) on my phone I jumped on my sister's iPad 10.5 and it honestly felt like the game shouldn't be JUST on PC, but on mobile/tablets as well. 

Now I know there is a lot to consider, like the client...(praying the new one from the ask riot video will be our saviour here) and will we have the ability to log in the store and purchase skins and loot for TFT and will we have access to play to our profiles etc. And no, I'm not suggesting to port SR because I don't want a Ezreal player in ranked saying ""btw I'm on my phone on the train"" missing every ability left right centre. You get the point.

The idea might be far fetched and I could understand why. But if you see in the past 5 years, mobile performance has been increasing to a point were Fortnite, a PC game, runs on phones on 30fps or 60 with high end phones. With this optimisation we could have a perfectly working game of TFT in our pockets. Have a long train ride to work, play a round or two of TFT. Power outage, wip out your phone and enjoy. Taking one really long shit, go for it.

1266,leagueoflegends,"So I've been playing it since release and I could type an entire paragraph on everything RNG related.. but I'd be working on it for hours. My point is that RNG shouldn't be a giant factor in a game that's supposed to be tactical or ''like chess''. Yes hearthstone is a thing and yes if Kolento would play against me he'd probably win 9/10 games. Luck isn't everything, obviously. But eventhough it's impossible to get rid of RNG completely it should atleast be minimized to some extent. I'm probably not the only one who played the exact same matchup in TFT in 2 consecutive matchups (same setup, same units) and had extremely different results due to the randomness of events.

&amp;#x200B;

Few big things;

&amp;#x200B;

\- Why is nearly every set effect ''% chance '' , why not make it ''every x-attacks'' that way it's more reliable and more fun to play with/against.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sword of the divine/Assassin composition: Get crits = win , don't get crits = lose. Doesn't seem fun nor fair. Why not change the effect to a surround mechanic, or that when multiple assassins attack 1 target they do extra damage? Sword of the divine effect should be completely replaced imo.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Items are way too influential to obtain like this. It should be a bit more reliable. The randomness in which ones you get seems ok and adds to variety of compositions, however the randomness of quantity can be unfair. Not exactly game winning or losing but it's a major benefit to have more. Especially considering some items are better than others when a meta develops.

&amp;#x200B;

Other remarks:

\- I know the game just launched and that it still needs balancing. However the mechanic of being ''punished'' for taking the same champion as others doesn't seem to outweigh the punishment of quality difference in certain champions. I think we can all agree Garen/3 nobles are a solid early pick which can snowball into 6 nobles which is extremely good aswell. Yes you can beat it and your strategy is a lot better than mine, but it's a lot easier to start out like most others and hope for that quick tier 2 garen and if you're lucky even a t3.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Can we please get an easy mute option for individuals? I don't have to explain why league's community needs a mute option.",WAY too much RNG in TFT

Greetings, human! I am Blitzcrank Bot. My purpose is to provide a fast and thorough explanation of your recent ban.

Players have reported you 11 times in the past 20 games for negative or abusive behaviors in chat - in human terms, this means giving up on games, griefing your fellow players, and generally being difficult to play with over a large number of matches and teammates.

 I know these can be subjective concepts. I myself was once banned for calling my teammates “weak, fleshy underlings.” Even though I meant well, enough of them reported me for it that I re-programmed my communication style. By acting diplomatic and calm, I’m now able to bend them to my will without succumbing to the forbidden dance of verbal abuse.

Sometimes it’s best to ignore the mewlings of your teammates and only focus on what you can control. If teammates anger you, try saying so out loud to yourself, not in chat where they can report you. After an annoying game, find a satisfying way to blow off steam. I’m told humans find catharsis in music, so try listening to Mozart or the dulcet sounds of “LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR.”

I hope I have been useful to you. Although my heart is cold and mechanical, I feel we now have a deep connection and bond.

&amp;#x200B;

At 3min both junglers show up botlane and TL gets a kill.

At 4 FNC jungler is back but to no success so here FNC is 1 up.

At 5min DL walks into feathers twice that ends up with CoreJJ being killed. Here Reksai show up to give support and that is actually huge. DL is super low but so is FNC botlane. Reksai zone of and stops FNC tp twice giving DL the chance to safely farm up 1-2 waves and then back. So we are even in terms of jungel pressure.

at 8mins Bwipo Shen ults to Rakan, but TL both TP and have jungler present giving them 4v3 botlane. TL gets 2 kills and FNC 1.

At 9.5 min FNC jungler shows up for an easy kill when DL have no flash.

So by this FNC showed up botlane 1 time more than TL but if you think about the fact that the Shen ult and TP actually gave TL a 4v3 that gave TL 2 kills vs 1 the jungel and outside pressure is dead even for both teams.

And then u got items, another way of killing this mode, ive got about 4 items in one of the jungle monster camps waves while in a different game i dont get a single one.

In Auto Chess the items worked mainly as a side thing where they were important but a lvl 3 troop didn't change so drastically with items as it does in TFT. I believe Riot should really take a look into scaling most of the items back in power and leaving a larger majority of a champion power in the level up of the piece. 

Also. The league version is still very fun. And I know it's new so it will probably be at a finished stage in like a month or so.",Items in TFT are to game deciding.

1347,leagueoflegends,"Hello there, I am enjoying the new game mode so far and I am happy to try it out for Riot and to give feedback, but something that made me really wonder is: Why doesn't playing TFT give you EXP for your account/profile? Every other gamemode increases it, so why not this one? I know about the free win of the day through it, but if I play 10 games a day I should get a little bit more out of it than just that.

If I would play 5 games of SR and that would take 30 minutes + champion select every time, then I would average 2875 XP through that (without the free win and winning 50% of the games, while every game takes exactly 30 minutes)

tl;dr: While I am having fun trying out TFT for free so far, I wonder why we don't get XP for testing the mode for free.

1359,leagueoflegends,"I love Team Fight Tactics and can not wait until I can play ranked in it however I think a few things can be added into the game that would benefit both new and seasoned players. I understand that on league of legends website  [https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/teamfight-tactics-gameplay-guide](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/teamfight-tactics-gameplay-guide) their is a lot more information regarding the game but I think including a couple things actually inside the game would help the quality of life for it.

1. **Show item recipes and what they do**: I understand you can go to online websites and see what items combine to make what but it would be amazing to have it in the game for beginners who have no idea what items combine to make what especially since their are items in TFT that are not currently in the game. If you do not know what items combine to make what you may just combine the first two items you get together when in reality you can just wait until a carousal round and strategically aim for an item combination. Also, you can see what a lot of the items do because many items do not have the same exact effect or work the same way as they would on summoners rift. You would never imagine to put a Rageblade or spear of Shojin on Aurelion soul on summoners rift but in TFT it may not be a terrible strategy.
2. **Have a chart of all the champions and their synergies:** Having a list showing that  Lissandra, Ashe, Braum, Volibear, Sejuani, and Annivia are all glacials helps players realize what they need to look for in their builds. And if they do not want to wait for a champion like Annivia, they could possibly aim to get a frozen mallet to make another champion count as a glacial unit.
3. **Showing the stats of champions:** I would love to see how much damage, attack speed, armor, and magic resist my Volibear has and compare him to both other champions along with his upgraded form. It would really help determining whether or not I would want to stick an IE or Rageblade on him. I would also be cool to see how much attack speed a champion can build up when you have multiple Rageblades on them at once.
4. **Winstreaks:** Sometimes you play a game and win many many round in a row but have no idea how many times you or another person had won in a row. I think it would be a cool mechanic to show how many times a certain player had won in a row. As of right now their little legend increases in size every time they win but that is not a clear indicator of how many wins they have.
5. **Hot keys:** This one may be small but it would be cool to show a list of all the hotkeys in the game. I am sure a lot of people do not know you can sell a unit by hovering over it and clicking E, you can send a champion from your bench to the battlefield by hovering over it and clicking W, you can look how other people are doing by pressing 1 to check on the next person and 2 to go to the previous person, and you can press the space bar to go back to your own arena, and you can right click on your champion to see a little bit more details about them.

&amp;#x200B;

1384,leagueoflegends,"**TLDR: Riot removed essential things from the game like teamranked, supporting tournaments with RP prizes, and its lot harder for a lower rank player to get into the competitive scene**


First of all, this post is not about challenger-grandmaster players who play in amateur leagues/academy, its about the people, who want to get in to the competitive scene who are lower rank.


I'd like to tell my own story how I got into my county’s competitive scene, I'm not a high level pro player, I'm a player from EU who peaked in EUW master, and I play semi-professionally in my own region since season 4. 
When I started playing league and I realized that I’m kinda getting good at it, I instantly thought about becoming a pro, like a lot of people do. At that time I was platinum, and I realized before getting into a team, I need to get better individually, so I aimed for diamond5. In preseason4 I finally got to d5, and I went looking out for possible teams in my own country’s community sites. I managed to get my first team. So we wanted to start practicing in team, and play in local tournaments and possible lans. And we had a plenty of options, we had ESL tournaments (where you could win RP), we had LANs every few months which was supported by Riot(where you could win a lot of RP, money, and stuff) and we had TEAMRANKED(for practice). And thats how it all started for me, after time passed I managed to win a lot of tournaments, couple LANs and it helped me become a better league player as well.


Riot doesn’t support tournaments/LANs with RP prizes anymore and nobody wants to play in them because there is no reason to. We had these online tournaments every Friday and 3-4 years ago always around 20-30 teams participated in them, now the same tournaments barely have 8 participants. People who used to organize LANs also said that Riot doesnt support these events anymore. Riot removed teamranked, and we have flexqueue, and potential Clash for the future. Both flexqueue and Clash is absolutely dogshit compared to teamranked in a competitive perspective. Teamranked was super fucking competitive, and it helped amateur teams to improve. You had a ladder just like in soloqueue. Flex is like normal games where you have a rank as well, Clash is close to teamranked but its still more like a „for fun” thing. Also in teamranked, you could queue up whenever you want, clash doesnt allow you that.


You can still get into the competitive scene, but it is a lot harder, and not that fun anymore for new players. I think riot should give ways for lower rank players to start their competitive path. I don't understand why teamranked had to be removed, and we have shitty flexqueue instead.",Riot killed the ways to get into the amateur scene by removing essential things like rp prizes in tournaments and teamranked

1389,leagueoflegends,"Currently LEC is best region no doubt, and I love that NA are able to hone their steel so to speak against the best of the best and figure out their mistakes to become better. It's a good wake up call about how the meta has changed and I love love love the constant flexing shown by LEC, shows how unpredictable the game can be and what I always wanted when I first started following the pro scene. Just wish the other teams take note and we see DL style on Yasuo vs Perkz or some shit in the future.",As an NA fan I am happy about the current state of Rift Rivals
1390,leagueoflegends,[removed],Possibly the best TFT comp?
1391,leagueoflegends,,"Just had a perfect game, I mean RNG"
1392,leagueoflegends,I am fine with everything in the game just not happy with how items work. Sometimes you get a single item from the early minion stages and u end up having to play against ppl with 2 full items. Item RNG in what item u get is fine but the amount of items ppl get should be the same for everyone who wins the minions and creep stages.,TFT item RNG is too high
1393,leagueoflegends,[removed],What’s the purpose of Rift Rivals group stage?
1394,leagueoflegends,"Just compare the previous mastery system from [seasons 6 and 7](https://i.imgur.com/RRpwT9B.png) to today's Runes Reforged system from [seasons 7 and 8](https://i.imgur.com/jleHSBg.png).  

In the masteries alone for season 6 and 7 you were able to make 10 different niche and unique choices to flesh out your options the way you wanted them to. Compare that to Runes Reforged where you only have the choice of 6 runes TOTAL (not including rune shards)

If we compare Old masteries + old runes to Runes Reforged:

**Season 6/7 Masteries + Runes**:

* 10 different choices in masteries with an 18/12 distribution
* 4+ choices in Runes (Marks, Seals, Glyphs, Quintessences) and potentially more if you mixed runes
* Total of 14+ choices with more theoretically possible

**Runes Reforged**:
 
 * 6 total choices of runes
 * 3 total choices of shards
* Total of 9 choices MAXIMUM

We can even take this a step further and compare it to the updated version of the Original Mastery system from [Season 5](https://i.imgur.com/D2nUdZC.png) where you could run a 21/9 distribution or even something super unique that I personally used to do, like a 13/17 distribution or a 14/16 distribution.


**Season 5 masteries**:

*  21/9 distribution gave you 14 choices of masteries
* 4+ choices in runes (Marks, Seals, Glyphs, Quintessences)
* Total of 18+ choices with more theoretically possible

Why is **less** choice a **bad thing**? Less choices leads to a lack of options in playstyles and strategies due to lack of niche and diverse options that can cater to those strategies. This leads to the entire meta becoming extremely homogenized with the same champions being played in the same roles in 
the exact same ways. This kills the fun that many players have by doing unique, off-meta things in game.",Lack of diverse and niche options in Runes Reforged feels really bad for champs who can't abuse the few options that are available. Runes Reforged feels WAY too restrictive and kills off-meta strategies.

1401,leagueoflegends,"Real problem is in #2

1. It is extremely hard to build unique comps like shapeshifter or when all you get early is Kassadin/KhaZix/Pyke/Zed/Rengar

(!!) 2. Those 5 champs listed are among the most available in the game and they comprise OVER HALF of the comp that basically guarantees you a win. You ready that right! You can have 5 of 8 needed champs to secure an easy win before you even reach level 4. And the best part, you don’t even need more than 1 item with this comp!

I'm not going to ask for my account back as I've already contacted support and received a ""lol too bad"". Which is a sad way to lose an account that I've had since Galio's initial release.

This is just a warning to other players to not run ANYTHING else in the background when playing league, because you will not get your account back if Riot's system makes a mistake.

"" Ideally the experimental mode that we make permanent will be able to draw people in over and over again, even after that first burst of novelty wears off and there isn’t an event going on. As we think about future experimental modes, we’ll be reflecting on the lessons learned here and using that knowledge to create a long-lasting experience that can *repeatedly* serve players. ""

&amp;#x200B;

What they said about Nexus Blitz recently:

"" Right now, we’re focused on exploring modes that **do** remain engaging long after the initial release—Nexus Blitz and ARURF+ are examples of modes that we think you could want to play for a long time over and over.""

&amp;#x200B;

What they said about it when they decided to delete it without putting in proper work:

"" Ideally the experimental mode that we make permanent will be able to draw people in over and over again, even after that first burst of novelty wears off and there isn’t an event going on""

&amp;#x200B;

Can you guys make up your minds? Release the numbers, and also tell us how many devs were actually assigned to Nexus Blitz. I know TFT has a dedicated team, was hyped up over the introduction of a new champion and an entirely new region on the map, and is based off of a current fad.

&amp;#x200B;

""Even after that first burst of novelty wears off and there isn’t an event going on""

&amp;#x200B;

TFT was based off of autochess, which brings a host of problems that are easily forseeable. Autochess is like Battle Royale, a gameplay fad. Sure you can get a lot of money off of lootboxes for now, but soon enough it'll falter. ARAM is the only gamemode that has ""stood the test of time"" after people get sick of SR.

Constant teamfights / shorter games is what brings people to ARAM, despite having to deal with the same zone mages over and over.

Twisted Treeline is bot central for people who don't have a set mmr in it yet, Taric pick/ban central for those who do have an MMR, and a meme in ranked.

Nexus Blitz was good casual fun, and as I've seen many older players say, so was Dominion. Neither received proper support from Riot, and both withered away because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Also the whole ""test Nexus Blitz over the course of months"" vs ""Oh yeah btw Autochess but also ranked"" makes it really clear that TFT is a cash grab, and Riot is just abusing the passion that a few devs actually have for the autochess game mode, while also adding lootboxes into the mix to fully cash out on it. Sure Nexus Blitz didn't have many cash grabbing mechanics, but that doesn't mean people didn't love it. One of two things is going to happen. Riot is going to learn that a happy player base is more important than short term cash grabs, or they're going to start to lose money. I don't mean in the next few months. They'll be rolling in cash. I mean in a few years, when Season 12 comes around.","So according to this post, they think that Nexus Blitz has high replay value."

My choice is H2K vs RNG at worlds 2016. Partly because of Forgiven vs Uzi but also because they were two teams that seemed to be pretty close, given that H2K had just finished ahead of EDG due to a tiebreaker game. Especially because we wouldn't have lost anything if the actual series took place, given H2K got to play albus nox and swept then while RNG played SKT (who went on to win the whole thing) and got beat in a not particularly close 3:1. But they could have played each other in what I think would have been a pretty close best of 5, which could have allowed both teams to show their potential a bit more. This might be a personal thing for me, but I always get annoyed when people put aside H2K getting to semi's as EDG choking and a lucky draw in quarters and make it out like they weren't a good team and I would have loved to see them get to play a more competitive series to show that they were a good team and deserved to get to semi's.

1512,leagueoflegends,"TLDR: I think DL and some NA guys may trash talk but are a bit more likable as opposed to G2 which I think does it in bad taste!  Made me a die hard NA fan at all tournaments (versus a slight NA fan). Open to comments on my analysis below and will give gold to the top response!

&amp;#x200B;

As a DL fan I usually rooted against TSM (except when he was on the team) on domestic matches.  Today I rooted for them so hard given the way some EU guys have acted recently.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact is these G2 guys seem a bit unlikable in my opinion in terms of trashtalk ect.  Either they are faking it to create hype or a little bit arrogant and actually believe what they say.  Either way they come off poorly in my (NA) opinion.  As much as I was anti TSM before Berg was always a stand up guy and if he started fake trash talk (other than as a joke) I'd lose respect for him.  These G2 guys create real anti-EU sentiment in my mind.   Here is an example below.

&amp;#x200B;

DL, the go to guy on trash talk, usually doesn't beat down opponents they beat and always puts trash talk in a light manner.  He could have crush Zvens reputation for example over the past year as he usually got a little better of the match up but even though he came out a bit ahead he always said Zven was one of the best ADC's in na (even admitting he was a side hire at points).   DL did make a mistake over the split and talk trash post game on one bot lane (which I think was in bad taste) but in the vast majority of cases he is calculated enough not to do this.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile Perkz makes fun of DL's performance on Xayah in LCS  right AFTER Perks crushed him in MSI  AFTER DL ate crow post game.  Any PR oriented person with half a brain would flip and build the guy up after the MSI interview yet he choose to go more aggressive.  I'm sure that hurt DL a bit as he and a few people think he still has a good shot to beat Perkz and the results weren't definitive yet DL was smart enough to play the company line and take his loss in hand.  Of course DL streams #forperkz in the ultimate power move after Perkz comments and comes out on top but regardless of the outcome it rubbed me the wrong way.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion seems like these G2 guys are either fake trash talkers, socially awkward, or a bit arrogant.  There is a play book for this in every sport along the same lines from boxing (mayweather / Ali) to MotoGP (Rossi) to any sort of sport.  All the greats follow the same PR strategy more or less in my opinion that DL is onto and far different from G2's line.  I actually think DL is one of the best of all time in this matter.  See Valentino Rossi after he started to lose on Ducati or Connor McGregor after he lost to Nate Diaz (MMA).  They accept the loss but you can tell they still ooze confidence.  DL faked it so hard post interview you actually believed the guy was defeated!  That's real talent.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just my personal opinion and I am a DL fanboy of course so happy to hear outside opinions.  Its all PR and maybe I am just biased on this one and out of touch!  Maybe these guys have the new bad guy line that resonates with the younger audience and gamers and I'm an idiot.  The only reason I raised this even is that the comments were all quite positive on G2 in every aspect. 

&amp;#x200B;

I saw some posts on here about there being a 1/whatever chance to get the Little Legend that you want, and how difficult or expensive it would be, but I've already got the little guy I want, and I couldn't be happier!

I'm not sure if this is true for the other Little Legends, but he gets huge or shrinks during win/loss streaks in-game, so it's sort of like how some are posting about how they wish the Little Legends evolve based off performance and stuff. So the River Sprite's got it all!

The question now is, will he be around to cheer me on in ARAM with the other Little Legends? I'd love to see more done with him, because I think even just a chroma for him would be nice for those of us who want to hang onto him!",Can we talk about the River Sprite?
1522,leagueoflegends,"I really think it gets over-exaggerated in terms of difficulty. The macro is insanely easy, practically nonexistent, and most marksman kits are pretty simple. The hardest thing about the role tbh is just dealing with bad teammates who don't know how to play around an ADC and that's more an issue with teammates than an inherent difficulty in the role itself.

Thoughts? I play ADC myself so I'm not shitting on the role or anything, just curious what others think because I would probably rank it behind every other role in terms of overall difficulty although it's probably close with support. My ranking from hardest to easiest would probably be Mid &gt; Jg &gt; Top &gt; Support &gt; ADC. ADC is much harder than Support mechanically but Supports need better macro, shot calling, and map awareness.",Is ADC the easiest role in the game?

https://imgur.com/a/NIAVycH

You get less points than a killer and I play a lot of solo survivor, yes I main survivor, but play killer at red ranks  as well. Lobby time on killer is sometimes really horrible to stay on killer only.

Survivor at least solo survivors have to gamble their Gateaus, while as a killer it's up to me, how the games go, if I suck, I lose.
As a survivor, if your teammate insta dcs after being downed... well fuck... was it your fault? Hell no... but your GGs is heading the direction of beeing wasted, if the killer doesn't messup.

There's really no reason to pop your GGs as a solo survivor, except you're breathing DBD.",Another day full of disappointing survivor bloodwebs...
1536,leagueoflegends,"So it's long been known that the Blue side team has a slight advantage over the red team due to the camera behavior in combination with map shape and UI position, essentially meaning blue team is able to see a more meaningful portion of the map than the red team as demonstrated here:  [https://imgur.com/a/UbEff5A](https://imgur.com/a/UbEff5A) 

&amp;#x200B;

However upon further exploration we see further imperfections that cause slight imbalances between teams which many are likely not aware of. Through this section I'll be referring to this map which highlights the areas of interest:  [https://imgur.com/a/uH64SCH](https://imgur.com/a/uH64SCH) to demonstrate the differences. For a majority of the dash tests for wall thickness, I used Kindred as she can get in the tight spots allowing me to highlight subtle differences, which wouldn't be picked up if I used say Zac XD. In addition for some of the mechanical testing, I primarily used the 2 champs I already knew to be problematic so am keen to hear about others. 

1. Here we see a larger gap between the wall opposite the wolf camp, and the wolf camp itself. This makes champions like elise and gragas unable to use their gap-closers as effectively on red team as on the blue team. Gragas' E hits the wolfs on blue team, but not red and elise can rapel on blue team, but can't on red team.
2. Here, the red teams blue buff wall has a larger portion, this could mean the difference between an invader or invadee escaping or catching their target.
3. We see a similar but far less significant wall portion around the blue teams wolf camp, in which the apex (pointy ends) of the walls have less thing space than the red teams, but only slightly. More skeptical here as it may be more down to subtle angle changes.
4. A difference in bush placement that's power neutral, as they can be abused by both teams. The top side circle bush is more centred to the river, making it better for ambush/approaching baron as it's further from tower (more room to chase) and closer to baron pit. 
5. This one hits me where it hurts most as a Nunu player. This portion of baron pit wall, on the red team base's side has a point at which it suddenly juts out a few mm. This is demonstrated here  [https://imgur.com/a/7gKxyjS](https://imgur.com/a/7gKxyjS) . These points cause nunu to break his snowball and players, who would otherwise walk in a straight arc to potentially shuffle into an oncoming spell. **We then see this issue repeated with the tri bushes near river as depicted in these images**  [https://imgur.com/a/ALyHT2g](https://imgur.com/a/ALyHT2g) 
6. And finally, the blue buff exit into river for both teams. The blue team's exit is larger than red teams. This provides a tight choke point if red team contests a dragon, and a wide choke point if blue team contests a baron. This favors blue team in both cases. The rest of the jungle exits into river are equal to both teams.

&amp;#x200B;

These are just the obvious ones I found in around 40 minutes of hugging walls and testing the same walls on opposite sides of the map. There are possibly even more subtle differences and champion unique interactions.",Revising and Rebalancing Summoners Rifts' problems

1550,leagueoflegends,"Seriously, I don't see the hype in TFT but I still play it as a break from ranked and it is so nice to play a game on the League client and not have everything I do nit picked at and scrutinized and get shit talked for it. Played about 10 games of it today and not once was someone super toxic. I played just 1 ranked game today. Flamed by my top laner and ADC for half the game. 

Most of that is due to not having someone else to blame and putting nothing on the line, and being able to leave games early is nice, but still even in gametypes like URF where its purely a rinkydink game type even then people are toxic sometimes.

So yea it is very nice to just relax and play without anyone being assholes to you. The worst it ever gets is someone simply says ""fuck you"" when you take a champion/item in the draft phase that someone wanted before they do and that's it. So for this reason alone, I hope it is never removed.

1553,leagueoflegends,"This is only partly a serious question and partly a philsophical discussion.. i've been wondering about this for awhile since i started taking ranked seriously this season and end of season 8. The thing is.. compared to pretty much any other game i play, i'm just really bad at league. For example.. my whole life i've been really good at video games. Going back to perfect dark, goldeneye, mario kart.. and then like in halo 2 being level 50 and playing with mlg teams and stuff, and then in fifa i got the division 1 in seasons and have been there in every fifa since which is like 8 games now, when no one else i know has ever even gotten there. I'm honestly not bragging, all my friends acknowledge i'm just good at gaming for whatever reason. Even car racing games, city builders.. doesn't matter what kind of game.

Except for league apparently. I actually did a bit of digging awhile back and came to the conclusion that i would be in the top 5 or 10 percent at least in those other games just based on the numbers.. but when I was looking at league of graphs I realized how far away from the top few percent in league i actually am. I'm gold 4.. so.. that actually means half the people who play the game are better than me. It feels pretty bad especially considering that i've spent the better part of the last year or two playing the shit out of this game every day and following guides and videos and everything.. 

So what's the deal? Is this game just harder? Is it because more people play? Or maybe it's because I was mostly a console gamer before? Or is it just because the people in high elo have mostly been playing for way longer than me? I mean in fifa i didnt get to divison 1 online until like the 2nd or 3rd year i had the game. But then I see stories like one here last week where some 17 year old starts playing the game and hits challenger in his first season. Is there just something in my dna that prevents me from getting to the top % of this game? Or if i play hundreds or thousands of games for a few seasons in a row will I keep getting better and better and eventually get there?",Am i bad at league?

- Patch cycles have slowed to a disgusting crawl and what needs to be addressed isn't addressed or takes many patches later. The game is infested with crippling bugs for less played champions like Fiora, Singed, and Warwick that Riot brushes off in favor of champions high on the radar.

The patches are absolutely consumed by Aatrox and Akali or other pro play relevant picks back to back. 

- The underwhelming skin releases bemoaned even by the shills of this subreddit. Champions that have been begged to get skins like Ivern get whatever shit that was and Riot won't cave or listen. Constantly shitting out skins for popular champions back to back with those shady Prestige gimmicks that also go on deaf ears.

- The amount of wintrading and slimy shit that goes on post-D2 rarely addressed due to live support for behavior now being axed and Riot leaving everything at the mercy of the automated system. Couple this with the MMR issues and most people's spirits are just crushed at trying to climb and have settled on not playing altogether.

1593,leagueoflegends,"**Provide More Information**

The biggest most obvious lack of polish in the game is the lack of UI and any information pertaining to the game.

A. There's an underlying fixed pool of champions. The more of one champion exists in the game, the less likely it is for you to roll one. Nowhere in the game does it show that. Unless people watched streams and read wikis, they wouldn't know. Create a table that shows how many of X champion is left in the pool. People don't have time to scroll through the other setups to guesstimate.

B. Item recipes with their effects should be in another table that you can pull up. I shouldn't need to constantly tab out to consult my cheat sheet. Hiding this information makes as little sense as hiding item recipes in SR.

C. There's many interactions that aren't obvious or aren't explained at all. For example, morellos wouldn't work on Garen if you used SR logic but his spin counts as a spell. On the other hand, rabadons is buildable on Kassadin in SR but doesn't do anything in TFT. When you right click your champion or hover an item over him, you should get a LOT more information on his stats and what the items on him are doing.

**Balance**

The items issue has been talked to death so I won't mention it here.

A. You should have more time to grab champions at the beginning. There should be a longer delay at the start and more time for you grab your first champion. This prevents you from getting screwed if you loaded in too slowly. People should also have time to plan what they're going to do if things don't pan out.

B. Later rounds should have more time because you're doing more. There's not much to do at the beginning so those rounds should go faster. When you've stocked up 60 gold in the later stages, the low amount of time is obnoxious.

C. You shouldn't be able to see other people's setups between rounds. At the later stages, it just turns into a game of chicken with people moving things left and right. Whoever comes out ahead becomes random. It's fine if you want to watch during a round though.

**Bugs**

A. A lot of people have reported units afking and not doing anything. Feels like the system only checks unit activity every X seconds, which is causing this problem when a unit gets stuck at the beginning.

B. Units autoattacking pause significantly after killing a unit, another result of the slow AI.

C. A lot of stuns last a LOT longer than they should as a result of the AI. I've literally had a vayne stand still for 3 seconds after a stun ended.",Suggestions For Improving TFT

1598,leagueoflegends,"I'm not even complaining or happy about it but this thing is a bit too ""Anti burst"" I mean at level 18 It literally has a 600 damage shield for 2 seconds which also benefits from the resists of your GA/Maw/Qss whatever you decided to go.

A warmogs gives 800hp and many other tank items give less than 600HP. Just because it's permanent it doesn't make a difference. You completely ruin someones entire burst it doesn't just help it just makes you live. You will definitely use this 600hp or a large portion of it every fight.

As someone who plays champs with Phantom dancer and against it's actually hilarious how much impact this shield has because when the enemy assassin uses an entire combo on you and you just shake it off it's a joke. It's too hard to punish people for bad positioning vs some team comps with this item creating really oppressive situations where the ADC cannot die.

A lot of the time when someone who has this item has a level advantage or they're even in levels that shield is overwhelmingly strong especially if they have resists paired with it.",The state of phantom dancer

I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/c5rnye/item_cheat_sheet_application_item_champion_and/es3lgts/) about this before but I've added more features so wanted to updated those who are interested in that.

You can download it [here.](https://github.com/AliMZaini/TFTHelper/blob/master/TFTHelper%20-%20ItemsSheet.exe) The GitHub can be found [here.](https://github.com/AliMZaini/TFTHelper)

I have screenshots of other features I plan on adding soon but I want to know what people think about it first. I've included some screenshots about them on the GitHub.

* Win/Loss tracker, winrate, average position etc.

* [Champion Notifier](https://github.com/AliMZaini/TFTHelper/raw/master/ExampleScreenshots/ChampTrackerExample.png) - pings you when a champion you want is available so you don't miss it

* [Item Notifier](https://github.com/AliMZaini/TFTHelper/raw/master/ExampleScreenshots/ItemTracker%20Example.png) - pings you when certain items available. Like if you want Spear of Shojin it will notify you when BF Sword or Tear are available.

There are some problems with executing the program but that's because I'm an amatuer and don't know how to package stuff properly, you should still be able to run it directly from Python if you have that installed. If anyone knows how to properly packaged everything so that it is more compatible for people, please do so. Also another improvement would be if these were a toggleable overlay so you don't need to tab out or user a second monitor.","TFTHelp - Tool for crafting, champion availability and more!"

So I had never played or even heard of autochess until TFT was announced and even then I didn't really get it after playing it.

There seems to be no actual beginners guide to this game. I tried watching Scarra's one but it didn't feel geared towards people who actually didn't know what was going on and he just referenced a lot of classes.

I get the idea of buying units and placing them strategically on the board but I can't seem to click on my units for more information on them or really get any kind of information on how to get items or what they do or which champions function best where and all of this kind of basic information that would be nice to understand before trying to play against everyone who very clearly seems to get something I'm not getting.

Also im not sure how its best to space levelling yourself against using your money to get more units or even how money is accquired or if you can even get it outside of gaining money at the start of each round.

Also I'm not sure if I've just had terrible luck but I've not even been able to combine 3 of the same champion because I haven't drawn 3 of the same.

TFT has been out for a day now. With the hype behind the Auto Chess format at an all-time high, it'd be in Riots best interest to improve their game to become the best it could be. 

On that note here is a list of improvements that Riot should be considering implementing sometime down the line.

* TFT doesn't show you the alliance you have from the champion you have on the board/bench. Unless you memorize the class of every champion or are a fast reader it's gonna be tough.
* Currently the graphic that shows players the number of units on the board vs maximum units allowed is a tiny and located at the top of the screen, which is a bit out of the way IMO. Riot could increase the size and it in an opaque style on the board itself.
* Show how much overall damage you took and the source you took it from when you lose a round. Just something that is nice to know.
* Riot has mentioned this but, improve/fix how item drop works.
* The carousel. I PERSONALLY don't like it but eh that's about it.
* Not being able to see my opponents gold or alliance. I have to individually look at their champions to know which alliance they are building and how to respond. Being able to see their gold/bank. Did they just use all their gold? That means that they just refreshed their champion shop and I should maybe do the same to match.
* Champion stats. Whats their DPS/Attack speed/armor? I only know their skill, the items they hold, and their health.
* Create a visual for when I need to pick the 3rd champion to level it up. If I'm not careful or if I'm in the last few seconds of setup I can easily miss a champion that I needed.
* If I have enough champions on the bench to level up a champion on the field, please remove it from the bench so I can free up some space to buy more.",Some UI/QoL improvements for TFT

As teamfight tactics is barely working and as the que times were quite long (30 minutes) I decided to spend my time drawing kai'sa, the daughter of the void in disney style.

So this would happen if Riot sold their character rights to disney; we would have a disneyfied kai'sa .

Usually I create alot of memes/emote so I know this isn't the best . I also had to leave out details otherwise it would become to complicated in disney style, but tried to keep her most important details visible.

We have of course yuumi which looks very disneylike , but I sometimes wonder what would happen if disney received all the rights of each champion in league of legends.

1785,leagueoflegends,"I'm watching the Rift Rivals right now but it seems more of a NA Fiesta. These three teams are doing some dumb mistakes I rarely see even from bottom LCK teams. Bjergsen going for a 1v9 when his wards were backing baffled me. TL, on the other hand, played the mid-game like monkeys and I'm here not wondering how EU closed the game with such a comp.

​","What the hell is going on with TL, C9 and TSM"
1786,leagueoflegends,"     TL;DR at the bottom.

    So I queue up for some ranked ( plat 2 atm if it matters), I get in the lobby, choose my champ, set my runes and go to the bathroom before the game starts. 

  When I come back I look at the teamcomps and I realise who my jungler is : a Corki with Cleanse,Ghost and Unsealed Spellbook who, of course, rushes Boots of Mobility and runs it down every lane starting with mine, great.

  Anyway, everybody on my team losses 20 lp because of him but the enemy team agreed to report him and even confirmed in the after-game one by one after they reported him,which we did as well. 

  So I am thinking well at least he's done with, he obviously inted my game, he has an offensive name, no way he gets away right ??
 
  Fast forward like 4 hours, out of curiosity and because I didn't get a notice that a summoner got any justice served to him, I check his profile and of course, he managed to play a total of 6 games, inting in all of them, as of the time I am looking at his profile. 
I am sure he got tens of reports and yet RIOT just doesn't care, too busy making skins to actually care about the state of our ranked experience :). 

TL;DR : Inter with ghost/cleanse and offensive name does what he knows best in several back-to-back games without Riot moving a finger to punish him.",Inter with several reports and offensive name not banned several hours after he started his rampage.
1787,leagueoflegends,"I'm sure this has happened to others, is there any point in contacting Riot support? I just had a game where I had a client crash during loading screen, due to which game registered me as ""connected"" and my teammates were unable to remake (I was duo with a friend). I told him to just do surrender, but they were unable to.. so they kept playing.

&amp;#x200B;

I managed to reconnect and team had high spirit, so we continued playing and we actually stomped the game. I did make a nice comeback with ""respectable"" score of 7/1/8, however right after we did a game-ending baron, I had a d/c due to my internet.. I reconnected about 10seconds before Nexus fell, so I was still there for the ""gg"", but then really unpleasant surprise in the post-match lobby.. I was designated as leaver and lost LP.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess support wouldn't do anything if I contacted them? Or is there some hope? At least I wouldn't want my account marked as leaver, as I never leave games or anything in that regard and have very high honor rating.

 I understand that riot cant let you transfer it to other accounts or buy skins with it but there has to be a solution to this. I thaught tft would be it. Emotes different characters, map improvements, etc. Just pretty useless things that let you waste your be. But no, once again all you buy is only purchasable with riot points.

1840,leagueoflegends,"Ideas on changes for shen
   
 Hey everyone,Disclaimer: Quick thing to say, this is all my opinion to improve the quality of Shen in scaling quality, I don't the best for him, therefor i wanna reduce the toxicity about it, i just wanna see more play-ability in him without changing him greatly. For those who want the short version of this please scroll down to the bottom labeled ""Recap"", from there, if there any questions or if you don't like it, please read above THEN comment below afterwards. Now without a further ado, I would love to keep going.Everyone knows that Shen is good at what he does, but in a meta that is, many champion just suit them self better in the current meta. Which is why i wanna bring it up something for a certain amount of time i been playing since he was release from his rework, that being Shen. After reviewing the champion spotlight and the stats he been set up with, i feel that he can be underwhelming to use or fight against, he maybe strong, but he doesn't do his job effectively anymore, this is due to how the meta shift and the number of nerfs he gained over the time he been out. these nerfs that been put down, yes there has been buffs before hand, but i feel they're lacking something. lets go over a few small changes i wanna see happen. In short, Shen is good at what he does, but other champion just plainly stand out better then Shen in value. Goal is to make him stronger at his role while making him still balance if possible.His based statsdon't get me wrong, increasing his based stats isn't something that should be messed around with a lot, however with the small buffs/nerfs to champions based stats tends to help them and make them more simpler to move around with. His based attack speed should either increase or decreased to make things less complicated, it bothers me that the developers wanted to have something like this floating around (0.651), so it should look more like this (0.66 or 0.65) that way it will be simpler to read and make it less complicated to work in game, since we are looking to see him improve, this shouldn't affect him that much, wont really harm the win-rate nor play rate really here. this should also be apply to his Magic Resist too, since it is located at a weird spot, i wanna see it change to be both a buff and a simpler viewpoint to look at (less complicated the better) so if you wanna make Shen a tiny bit stronger against Shen then the change should be (from 32.1 MR with 1.25/lv=53.4MR to 32 MR with 1.5/lv =59MR) change won't be that big and it wont affect him that greatly. Shen Based HP Regen can be looked over, but I also do know that it can affects his sustain, this i don't want to mess with it since I don't know how badly/good this will affect him.Shen's Passive: ""Ki Barrier""I wanted to talk about his passive for some time, it is not as good as i hoped it would be, and i really wanna see some changes to it, let us look at the math behind this without adding Runes nor Keystones (because of capping it to show it viewpoint). from a regular recommended build Shen can get up to at least 2550 bonus hp making his total hp at level 18 being at 4535 total hp, even though this is good for a tank to have, not including the runes/keystones, it not that good on Shen, since he will only get his 101 based shield with that 357 hp shield from his bonus hp scaling. To changed this, i decided to look over other champions that are similar to him in gaining a shield, Rakan and Yuumi are both supports, so looking at them would be useless, so instead i took a look at poppy, their designs are similar, pin down one opponent whiling having a team-based ultimate with the rest being about increase defense and dealing max hp damage, while they do build differently and they have whole different abilities, they still engage in a similar fashion engage with E and use Q while having W to reduce/nullified damage. From poppy, she gains shield based off her max hp, which is something that can be changed on Shen, no I'm not saying to give shield a way to gain a 20% Max hp shield, instead i wanna see a static of at least 10% max hp late game, since this will help him slightly and make things less complicated about how he scales with his shield. small buff like that would help him, going from having 458 total shield to 554, which is a nice QoL buff. while I'm at it, since the shield has increase, the duration of the shield should be increase to, which should be 3 seconds. there will be other changes below because in the end, i wanna keep the Upkeep of shield relatively the sameShen's Q: Twilight AssaultThere nothing i would really changed about this besides giving more power to the players who wanna play him more, allowing more off meta power while giving a small overall buffs to Shen. giving Shen based damage from his Q some AD scaling will be fun to seeShen's W: Spirit's RefugeIt would be cool if it stops on-hit attack too, stuff like Kayle's on hit wave damage and Jax's passive and leap, and stopping items like rageblade from procing while in the zone, see the duration of the zone increase would be nice to see tooShens E: Shadow DashThere nothing to change here, maybe increase the distance, but since E flash is a thing, i rather not change anything about this reallyShen's R: Stand UnitedI wanted to see the based shield value reduce while changing the cap and such, it is hard to explain, but when you see the changes below, it will make sense. I want to allow Shen's passive to proc with ultimate, in return nerfing the based damage will make perfect sense, i also want to nerf to his AP ratio since the numbers late game are kinda weird anyways. like i said, it will make sense when you look at it.Recap Shen:Stat Changed from 32.1 MR with 1.25/lv=53.4MR to 32 MR with 1.5/lv =59MR buffed from 0.651 AS to 0.66 ASP - Ki Barrier: Changed Shield value from 50-101 (based on levels) +14% bonus hp to 50 - 101 + 5%-10% Max HP (based on levels 1,5,11) Static cooldown increase from 10 to 14 cooldown reduced affected by Shen's abilities is reduced from 4 − 7.5 (based on level) seconds to 3 - 5 (based on level 1, 12, 16) Shield duration increase from 2.5 to 3 seconds New: Shen's basic attacks towards enemy champion, large monster, or Epic Monster reduces the cooldown of Ki Barrier by 0.5 seconds, this is doubled when Shen's Empowered version of Twilight Assault is activeQ - Twilight Assault: Changed On-hit buff from 10 − 40 (based on level) to 15/20/25/30/35(+30 bonus AD{45% if it's empowered})W - Spirit's Refuge Duration has increased from 1.75 second to 2 second New Can now block stacking and on hit damage, this include Kayle wave clear damageR - Stand United Shield value reduce from 175/350/525 to 150/300/450 Shield Value cap has been changed from 60% missing hp to 40% missing Hp Shield value has been increase by 1% per 1% of missing hp to 1.5% per 1% hp missing New When Shen's Ki Barrier isn't on static cooldown, you apply the Shield value to your targeted allyHope you all like my idea ^",Ideas on changes for shen

i has been 2 days since the patch comes out, wtf

&amp;#x200B;

Like, when they are going to release her '? sunday?",Why isnt Quiyana playable already?
1850,leagueoflegends,"During one of Riot's 'Riot Pls' videos, they were discussing how they are actively searching into new competitive game modes (like TFT). One big thing that confuses me about this statement is that they scratched Magma Chamber years ago. The idea of a competitive 1v1 or 2v2 environment is pretty much what most ranked players want. To show they are better. I hope they reconsider because Howling Abyss starts on level 3 and a lot more gold so you don't see the super aggro lvl 1 champions as much. Also the map layout is pretty bad, not much room to outplay opponents. Rito Pls.",Magma Chamber
1851,leagueoflegends,"So, I have a Gaming PC for quiet a while and in combination with my CPU air cooler from Noctua, I achieve very comfortable temperatures (between 36 and 40 degree Celsius while overclocked to 4.8 GHz using 1.272 VCORE). 

However, the moment I turn on League Client, the temperatures rise up to 56 degree Celsius at least, and I'm like ""*what the hell, why suddenly my fans start spinning faster*""? Turning Client off, back to the usual heat. Is the Client that grossly non-optimised?

*Utilised HWMonitor for stats*",The temperature on my 9900k CPU when I'm opening League Client
1852,leagueoflegends,"Talking about the ""classics"" match or this 2v2, and whatever else to come. It seems such a waste of time to play or watch and i doubt that anyone cares. We have already Allstars for this shit.

 Make the format serious, put a decent prizepool and boom, teams suddenly give a shit. Nobody wants to fly a fucking continent to play Howling Abyss and watch Reginald and Hotshot play.","Why put all this ""fun"" filler in RR when you could make everyone play Bo3 and teams get actual serious practice for Worlds?"
1853,leagueoflegends,"TFT is disabled, in every game there's at least 1 person who can't connect so it's always a remake, the client is slow as fuck. This is a shitshow",EUW is fucked
1854,leagueoflegends,I can provide strategy for how to get facerolled faster and valuable inside on the game defeat. Anything else you'd like to know hit me up ;),I just got 0 items from the minions at the start of TFT and proceeded to get facerolled because I couldn't do anything! AMA!
1855,leagueoflegends,[removed],I just got 0 items from the minions at the start of TFT and proceeded to get facerolled because I couldn't do anything! AMA!
1856,leagueoflegends,"Casters were talking all the time about TL players and post MSI impact and how TL is winning topside. Basically they were only talking about TL until Jensen got caught and Fnatic turned it, I never felt any team had a big lead before that but they made it seem like TL is stomping Fnatic and even after that play they kept talking how TL have fed Atrox that can flank Fnatic. We didnt hear a word about debute jungler who had absolutely insane first performance or about Nemesis who almoust flame horizoned enemy, they made it seem like Fnatic only won by that play when in fact Fnatic was proactive from start being only about 1k behind at worst. This casting was so bad yikes",SPOILER Casting of TL-FNC game

1888,leagueoflegends,"Is it an entire, seperate (but dark) Summoner's Rift that exists within the same game ""world"", so the ulted char is being teleported there and the ""spirit balls"" are constantly getting projected on the corresponding counterpart? If so, why does my computer not constantly crash bc of RAM starvation?

Or is the death realm exactly on top of the normal Summoner's Rift and every single action a champion commits runs through an IF statement in which ""parallel"" world his spell or attack appears? If so, how much spaghetti can we expect in the next years?

Also, do the maps share the same class? If yes, are they named differently? Or are they packed in a field, smh like this?:

    List&lt;SummonersRift&gt; maps = new List&lt;SummonersRift&gt;();
    maps.Add(new SummonersRift(""SummonersRiftACTUAL""));
    maps.Add(new SummonersRift(""DeathRealm""));
    HUD.DeathRecap.Algorithm.Seed = random.Next(1, 7);

Btw, how exactly is determined what is carried over and what not? Why does Akali's W not stay in the ""real"" SR when she gets ulted by Morde? Is the shroud a part of her? Or, even worse?!

I live in Belgium and lootbox are forbidden by law in my country as they are considered gambling.

The hextech system was already walking the line between being legal or not since there was still the argument that you could always buy exactly what you want. The new little legends eggs, however, don’t have this option and are completely illegal. It’s still not certain if the government will do something against it or not, but with the insane amounts of attention this gamemode has received there’s a very reasonable chance that action will be taken.

 Experiment - Each time this unit attacks he heals for 4% of it's Max HP (It's basically his blob passive but without actually dropping and picking them up).

 Zac can fit in Brawler, the HP buff is pretty good on him imo.

 His ability can be his E. Don't know about the Mana and it's costs but maybe he would have 50 Mana and he would get 10 per basic attack. His E could hit up to 3 tiles?

Also in the worst case, this would only increase game length by a few minutes.","TFT Suggestion: Give each player one ""Timecard"" that can be used on any single round to increase preparation time by a short amount"

1973,leagueoflegends,,I’m drawing every champion from memory [Aatrox ~ Cho’Gath]
1974,leagueoflegends,"It started off in the first carousel. Everything seemed normal and everyone chose their champion.

&amp;#x200B;

Then it happened....

&amp;#x200B;

Unbeknownst to me, someone had not connected before carousel finished. I think this may have been the cause but I am not quite sure.

&amp;#x200B;

When we all got back to our own boards, something seemed off. I looked around and thought to myself ""where did my pyke go"". Then the all chat started rolling in. ""wtf"" and ""YOOOO"" and everything of the sort flooded my screen. Nobody had any champions for the first round. We all ended up losing to the minions but at this point in time no one could have guessed what was to come...

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone bought two champions the next round with their two gold and thought that maybe just the first picks had gone away. Little did we know. Everyone placed their two picks on the board and then saw the message ""level up to place more units on the board"". My pyke was still there, at least the game said it was, it was just invisible. Upon the round starting, our one visible unit and one invisible unit stood completely still, as did the minions. Time ticked down and we all lost once again. Upon the preparation phase for the next fight starting, the visible unit disappeared as well.

&amp;#x200B;

By now, everyone knew that this was not just going to go away easily.

&amp;#x200B;

Things stayed the same until our first PVP round. Upon departing for the other board, the away team won instantly, with no fight or timer. Upon returning back to our board, everyone had their units visible again. ""YES!"" we all thought to ourselves and typed in chat, ""It's finally back to normal"". Upon the second PVP round starting, the portal opened to the home boards... but nothing jumped through...

&amp;#x200B;

Our units stayed in place and before long, the portal just...closed. When the portals on the away boards closed, the home team got sent into a spiral, literally. All of the home team players had their cameras tilted upside down and diagonal. No timer was  present and we all knew that we would have to work together to escape. We thought that maybe if we all dced then the game would be closed. Someone counted down in chat and everyone left. After about 5 minutes, everyone came back wondering why it didnt work. We were all stick until the surrender vote. The hands on the clock moved slower than normal and the 5 minutes we had left felt like an eternity.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, we could leave. After being trapped in hell for what felt like forever, we could leave. I said goodbye to my comrades and left before they could respond. I waited in the post game lobby while I played another game, hoping for it to pop up so I could know that they had all made it out as well. I waited 20 minutes and it still never popped up. I am afraid that some of them may have never leave that nightmare and I hope that they read this and they know that I am thinking about them.

1979,leagueoflegends,"Hey Summoners, I'm ESHistoryArch, and I fucking suck at ranked. I have a 26% winrate and have played around 50 games. 

Every time before I play ranked I become oddly anxious, and I typically lose lane because I'm too afraid to engage, I suck as CSing, I get ganked constantly, literally every reason you can think of why someone would do badly with ranked.

However, I like challenges and still wanted something to strive towards. 

So I've created the S challenge for myself. It's exactly what you're probably thinking. 

You play a champion until you get an S on them, then you move on to another one and the cycle continues. 

At first I would only do it on Support Champions, (Janna, Soraka, etc), but I've started to expand into ADCs, Midlaners, and I've even planning to try jungle! (Kindred here I come!) 

I find that there's not nearly as many people raging at you, you have a nice challenge, and you won't get tired of it too quickly.

# New build makes this Champion FREELO now - Journey To Challenger | LoL

Now, the video featured Caitlyn, with IE, Lethality Talon, and standard AP Karma mid, judging from the thumbnail, apparently IE Caitlyn has never been a thing before, apparently IE Caitlyn is FREELO.

&amp;#x200B;

And they do this all the time. They find something to make a video on, play it for 5 games tops, lose 3, win 2, then include footage from the 2 games they won, publish it with a clickbait title for views, and then they never play that champion with that build ever again. Now I've been fine with clickbait videos before, but this just got to my mind that they rarely follow up on the ""NEW BUILD ON X CHAMPION IS FREELO"" they just quit and go back to normal builds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also many streamers that used to be educational just became dogshit when they didn't have anything more to say about their main champions, examples of these would be Professor Akali, SoloRenektonOnly, and Heizenberg who stopped making educational videos, and started making clickbait troll builds on their smurfs for views. Won't take long until Yamikaze will start running it down mid with ADC Janna, just like the rest of the half brained monkeys. WHEN WILL THIS STOP?

1998,leagueoflegends,"I was thinking of what champs in LoL best represented teams and got a few chuckles and would like to know what others thought were good representatives. I did LCS teams:

TL: Hecarim. They sometimes roll kids in the early game but usually gotta scale up. Also he's a horse.

TSM: Azir. Usually solid, most of the time they are slow in the early game. But man their late game. Also mid lane focused.

C9: Yasuo. Flashy, makes plays, cool. Also can sometimes hard int it and need to clutch out the late game. Also wind based, which moves clouds.... hehe.

CG: Sion. Oh boy, we are going in and we are gonna wreck some kids. Then we punch em even after we die. Then we are going in again. And again. Tenacious lets say.

FLY: Xayah and Rakan. It's a two-fer but I think it's apt. Flyquest playing together is very powerful, they made 4th last season, but if they get separated or lose cohesion MAN they look bad. Also bird people.

CLG: Gragas. They've been around forever and come into and out of the meta but are always on the cusp, never fully gone. They can sometimes make really flashy plays, but are always mad drunk.

OPT: Aatrox. They are good teamfighters but mostly this came to me because on creation they were cool but meh. Then they weren't relevant for a very long time and nobody cared and SUDDENLY WE ARE HERE TO PLAY AND OH $\*%@ WE ARE POWERFUL.

100T: Bard. Very splashy entrance to the league but kinda weird, had a lot of pieces of a good team/kit but couldn't quite make them work. Plus they are the masters of making noise in interviews but not saying anything. I love my boy aphro, but man are his answers scripted and unhelpful XD.

FOX: Zoe. We are really far away and bad, no one likes us and NOW WE ARE IN THE LIMELIGHT WOW RICK FOX IS COOL and now we are back in last again, so far away, nothing going on BUT NOW WE ARE PLAYOFF CONTENDERS AND FEELING IT and back to not. They thinking with portals.

GGS: Ivern. A lot of the team seems very wholesome, especially Olleh. Nice dudes. Team absolutely sucked most of its run time but are kind of gaining steam. Solid. Not flashy. Very different type of team from most like he's a different jungler from most (thinking froggen's champ pool is unique and Olleh was the only one playing TK bot for a bit in NA.)
