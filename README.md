### My Data Science story began in DePaul University where I completed my Finance degree while working for a small ecommerce startup. I was interning at a small company called Region Free Titles which sold around 1 million items on Amazon per year, this opportunity helped me pick up useful skills, most importantly Excel and Database structures. I was tasked with building out a small cloud database for our inventory tracking, which thought me a lot of basics when it comes to storing data, calculating fields and more importantly learning online on my own. 

#### Some notable projects include >>>
- Implementing an inventory tracking system for our warehouse, built in Excel and Trackvia. Basically our warehouse employees would scan our received inventory into Excel and upload the CSV to Trackvia which did all the processing. 
- Implementing best practices for marketing our products on various platforms, specifically Amazon FBA, Google and Ebay. This included KPI tracking and analysis and periodic reporting. 
- Working in a start-up  enviornment gave me a lot of hands on experience talking with external stakeholders, and eventually creating pitch materials for targeting customers for our consulting products. I essentially became a salesperson as well as an analyst.

### After spending around three years growing this small company, I wanted to branch out to bigger opportunities, which is when I received an offer from a company in Boston, Kununu. At Kununu I got a taste of real data analytics and how a mid-size company operates specifically in a sales and marketing enviornment. I got valuable experience with DOMO, Social Media data analytics, Tableau and basic algorithms to rank sales leads. 

#### Some notable projects include >>>
- Building a sales leads ranking algorithm. This took raw leads from Monster.com and ranked them for our sales team. This score integrated into DOMO, Tableau and Salesforce.
